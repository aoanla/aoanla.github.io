&lt;p&gt;Quite apart from those, there are also international events in Newcastle (as Newcastle Roller Girls celebrate 10 years), Vienna,  and Vicenza; Short Track Roller Derby and referee clinics in Buenos Aires; and a National Meeting of minds in Manizales, Colombia!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Plus, more that we've not got space to summarise up here, and you'll have to read down for!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we covered in our article on the South African roller derby community &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/06/rollerderby-za-2019/"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; , the population of South Africa is concentrated in a small number of widely-separated areas, so it's very expensive for the teams to play each other (let alone teams from other nations). As such, having this one big event at the end of the year is an achievable focus, and the community time it provides is all the valuable for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In last year's NDF, Johannesburg's &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://goldencityrollers.com"&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/a&gt; , and Cape Town Rollergirls competed for the final rankings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Golden City Rollers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cape Town Rollergirls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The third team present, Durban Roller Derby, participated in the first two bouts, mixed teams games with skaters from all three teams.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt='The flyer image for this National Derby Fest: crouched jammer ready to sprint at start of whistle (in black and white, with red star), against horizontally divided yellow and red background box; yellow bar at top of flyer, red at bottom. Second box (positioned "on top" of the background, but "behind" the skater) reads "National Roller Derby Festival 2019". The logos of all three leagues with full teams are aligned along the bottom of the flyer.' src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/NDF2019.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/403124207306199/"&gt;National Derby Fest&lt;/a&gt; has a change of format, designed to maximise the amount of game play each team got. As such, this is National Derby Fest is a double round robin: each team will play the others &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;, in half-length games (two 15 minute periods). As numbers for all teams are a little low this year, this will allow everyone to participate in as much derby as possible, whilst still playing WFTDA-rules otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth league in South Africa, Pretoria's P-Town Roller Derby, will be donating a skater to the Cape Town team, and we assume will be donating volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners on points will go forward to play each other in a full-length WFTDA-regulation Final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden City Rollers told us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
NDF is the highlight of the local derby calendar, so we're super excited to host it this year, and to see all our sister leagues again. Of course, the most important thing is to play some derby and enjoy every second, as we don't often get a chance to compete in SA. Secondly, it's an opportunity to introduce new spectators to the sport, so we're hoping it will help grow roller derby in SA.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Derby Fest 2019 will be hosted at: &lt;strong&gt;Uniao Portuguesa&lt;/strong&gt;, 4 Eastwood street, Turffontein, Johannesburg, South Africa, on &lt;strong&gt;9 November&lt;/strong&gt;, starting at 0930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>golden city rollers</category><category>national derby fest</category><category>south african roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/nationalderbyfest-102019/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 21 Oct 2019 18:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Weekend Highlights: 26 October 2019</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/highlights/2019/weekendhighlights-26102019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another exceptionally busy weekend, so again we're moving Sunday-only events into a separate update later in the week.
Even doing that, it's a packed schedule, including: Bologna's Hyenas hosting two days of roller derby at the Ferrara Tattoo Convention, a double header of derby up in Aberdeen, Nantes and Gdańsk both hosting events to celebrate their leagues' respective anniversaries,  a whole sur5al tournament in New Zealand, and a &lt;em&gt;two-track&lt;/em&gt; international tournament in Hull! (And more - the first MRDA-sanctioned triple header in Spain, a weekend of derby in Querétaro... !)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to stick to our rules below, so a lot of events - especially in Australia, which is currently at the height of its Spring events schedule - are having to be missed off the list. (We're open to considering treating very large countries in terms of their constituent States, for the purpose of allowing events, but we'd like the community to let us know how they feel about that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Map of all events (coded by type)" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/10/26Oct-wkly-map.png" style="width: 100%;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We're not even mentioning the Short Track Roller Derby events this weekend to save space - they're all in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/10/shorttrack-102019/"&gt;this roundup post&lt;/a&gt; if you want to catch up with them (although we've marked them on the map). They're all highlights, but this is a super busy weekend, so something has to give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 3rd fixture of the Chilean national tournament happens this weekend, as does the final of the New Zealand Top 10 Championshops 2019; as well as a number of large tournament events (perhaps the largest being in Sydney, Australia, and Lille, France). There's charity derby in Teesside, and even an international roller derby bootcamp up north in Iceland!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).

There are exciting things to write about, across the world, as well, so we'll break this up region by region! Because of the prevalence of Facebook (and the fact that its Events are one of the few useful things about it), all links to events will be there; but we'll include enough info for you to get to the event without needing anything owned by Mark Zuckerberg. Where possible, we link to league websites, or to their Instagram when it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've also switched to a better map projection (Eckert IV) for this edition, to more accurately represent the scale of the countries and continents of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've broken our rule slightly for Germany this weekend, as it's important not to miss the Mine Monsters' birthday game, but also it's a good weekend for the German Bundesliga in Erfurt. And as usual there's so much stuff in France, we're giving them two entries for two two-day events...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two firsts this weekend; the first ever Tasmanian Tournament kicks off in Australia, and the first ever Norwegian National Tournament (and Championship) is this weekend in Sadnes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;
