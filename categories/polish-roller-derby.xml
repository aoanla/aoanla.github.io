There's multiple tournaments and international bouts: returning tournaments in Belgium, with Skate Around #3;  in Italy, with Scusa Mamma, Ma Sono Una Derby Girl; and in Argentina, with Juguemos Pué; in the UK, returing Roller Derby Sevens and Sur5al events; and continuing tournament series in Germany, France, and Japan (where Derby Nights 4x4's fixture is extra long due to the postponed bout in October).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

Even doing that, it's a packed schedule, including: Bologna's Hyenas hosting two days of roller derby at the Ferrara Tattoo Convention, a double header of derby up in Aberdeen, Nantes and Gdańsk both hosting events to celebrate their leagues' respective anniversaries,  a whole sur5al tournament in New Zealand, and a &lt;em&gt;two-track&lt;/em&gt; international tournament in Hull! (And more - the first MRDA-sanctioned triple header in Spain, a weekend of derby in Querétaro... !)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to stick to our rules below, so a lot of events - especially in Australia, which is currently at the height of its Spring events schedule - are having to be missed off the list. (We're open to considering treating very large countries in terms of their constituent States, for the purpose of allowing events, but we'd like the community to let us know how they feel about that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.

There's also a bunch of open scrimmages across the world, especially in the UK; and in Chile there's an open-subscription variant rules event which looks quite interesting (and tiring...)&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, in Scotland, we're raising money to fight cancer with the return of Charity Roller Derby Sevens tournament, Krustfest, for a second year, and in Spain they're holding a Roller Derby festival!&lt;/p&gt;

have multiple tournaments, bootcamps etc all on one weekend), but we also don't want to be so strict as to have
just 1 per country. So, we'll be doing the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two highlights a weekend - Sat + (All Weekend); and then a smaller one for Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend is particularly rich in short-format events, with Sur5al, Roller Derby Sevens, and Short Track Roller Derby all happening around the world! There's also a world premiere of the new Street Roller Derby ruleset (in Germany), which is another attempt at producing a simpler, easier-to-officiate version of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the UK, the &lt;em&gt;Scottish Clause&lt;/em&gt; means we're covering 3 different events, as our leagues are all off down south to play derby this weekend!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/whenuafatales/"&gt;Whenua Fatales Roller Derby League&lt;/a&gt; host their annual (Open To All genders) Sur5al tournament, allowing them to run
a full 16 team round-robin tournament in 1 day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flat Track Stats does not record Sur5al results (and the teams are all mashup) so this is not in FTS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

(Which is also why we don't have a Facebook event to link to.) This will be a three-team round robin, with MRDA-Sanctioned bouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

With 5 teams, including one from outside Europe, in an almost-round robin (only Middlesbrough versus Calgary is missing from the schedule), this is a packed two-day schedule on the weekend, with two games spilling forward into the Friday in a closed session. As is usual for Finnish events, there will be a livestream.&lt;/p&gt;

10 games are packed into one day (meaning that this is probably an elimination tournament, with some consolation bouts), with competitors from across Poland and Central and Eastern Europe!&lt;/p&gt;

Street Roller Derby is yet another ruleset designed to make Roller Derby easier and more convenient to play, with less officiating load, and a simplified ruleset. (In the case of Street Roller Derby: officiating is managed by skaters not currently playing; there's no "Lead Jammer" powers; scoring, like in Short Track is 1 point per pass, not per skater passed; there's also no set duration; a reduced penalty list; and harsher penalty rules (a penalty has you sit out the rest of the jam!) ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this ruleset is currently only really being promoted on Facebook. We hope that it will become more accessible to non-Facebook users in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Teams":&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;H.O.S.S.A. (North Germany / Netherlands )&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Black Tagada, Zombeers and Dead Dragibus, the three aspects of &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rollerderbycalaisis.fr/"&gt;Roller Derby Calais&lt;/a&gt;, collectively host a day of short-format roller derby, with the return (for the 5th time) of their &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.hitmyvalentine.com/"&gt;Hit My Valentine&lt;/a&gt; Sur5al tournament.
We say "Sur5al tournament", but really this is a whole weekend of Roller Derby surrounding the tournament: both days open with Open Scrimmage with special rules ("reverse derby direction" on Saturday, ), and the Saturday ends with a Junior Derby scrimmage as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flat Track Stats does not list Sur5al tournaments (and in any case, these will be teams created just for this event)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Event starts: 0930 Saturday (doors open)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venue: Forum Gambetta, 23 Boulevard Gambetta, Calais, France&lt;/p&gt;

The hosts, currently second-from-bottom on the leaderboard, face Hallam Hellcats, just one space above them, in a battle for safety from the relegation zone. Meanwhile, Aberdeen's Granite City, currently in that relegation zone, face the imposing Hulls Angels, currently in 2nd place!&lt;/p&gt;

The hosts currently top the leaderboard for this tier, with an unbroken win record, and it seems likely that this will continue, as they face relegation-zone placed Sheffield Steel. We expect a much closer game between Manchester B and Auld Reekie B; currently near-tied (even with score difference) for 2nd and 3rd place in the board!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.brewcitybruisers.com/"&gt;Brewcity Bruisers&lt;/a&gt; host the 10th edition of their annual invitational, the Midwest BrewHaHa! This is a multi-tier tournament with both MRDA-Sanctioned and WFTDA-Sanctioned bouts, as well as an unsanctioned B-tier for WFTDA leagues. With a huge number of participants, this is simply a tournament for WFTDA ranking, without a structure in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This invitational is of interest to us due to European participation in both the WFTDA-Sanctioned and MRDA-Sanctioned tiers, with France's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lommerollergirls.com/"&gt;Lomme Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;, and Belgium's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/mannekenbeasts/"&gt;Manneken Beasts&lt;/a&gt; playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WFTDA-tier Teams:&lt;ul&gt;

This is of interest to us due to the attendence of Buenos Aires' &lt;em&gt;`2x4 Roller Derby`_&lt;/em&gt; in both tiers - Team OSOM in A, and Lxs Pibxs in B. As with Finvitational, this is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; a round-robin for both tiers!&lt;/p&gt;

What makes this one special is the inclusion of a Juniors bout, and the attendance of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/baja.rollerderby/"&gt;Baja Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; from Mexico. (Once again, the WFTDA part of the tournament is &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; a round-robin, missing just Misery Loves Company versus SoCal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Short Track Roller Derby events calendar is building for the year already, and there's a lot of things to talk about, so we're bringing you a new edition of the Short Track News roundup earlier than we expected to!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first development is that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/"&gt;Rolla Skate Club&lt;/a&gt; now host a dedicated &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track Roller Derby Resources&lt;/a&gt; page, with the rules and other info.
(We know that it's also set to gain more resources, too, as they're produced.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="Animated Gif of Short Track resources page" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/ShortTrackResources.gif"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The new Rolla Skate Club "Short Track Resources page"!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA, the biggest Short Track event upcoming is probably the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://rollercon.com"&gt;Rollercon&lt;/a&gt; event series. Building on their appearance at the last Rollercon (the public debut of the ruleset, in fact),&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Rollercon 2019 will feature multiple items:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;ul class="first last simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"AA-level" Short Track Exhibition Game "Short Skirts versus Sleeves" (20 July, 20:45)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 MVP-pass holder on Skates sessions on Short Track with Rolla Skate Club [19 July 16:50, 20 Jul 18:00]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Track Scrimmage for Short Track (19 July, 20:00)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you're at Rollercon from the 17th July, then we encourage you to go check it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other US and Canadian teams continue to use Short Track Roller Derby; Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby, in particular, continue to be a purely Short Track league, and are holding regular open training sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Canada, we know that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/nelsonrollerderby/"&gt;Nelson Killjoys&lt;/a&gt; of British Columbia, will be hosting a tournament for 6 teams, at some point later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Alberta, Canada, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://fmrollerderby.com/"&gt;Fort McMurray Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are planning to use short track rules for their home teams season, allowing them to support more home teams with their current roster. (Scheduled for around October 2019)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The first edition of Iru Navarro's fanzine, including an introduction to Short Track rules." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/05/shorttrack-fanzine-latin-america.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The first edition of Iru Navarro's fanzine, including an introduction to Short Track rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further afield, Latin America continues to explore the Short Track ruleset [an Argentine fanzine is covering the rules in translation issue by issue], and in South Korea, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/OHDerbyKorea/"&gt;OH! Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; (Facebook link) are hosting scrimmages using the ruleset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In South Africa, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.capetownrollergirls.com/main/"&gt;Cape Town Rollergirls&lt;/a&gt; are planning a second Short Track event after the success of their first on the 26th April. Whilst not announced officially yet, the &lt;strong&gt;8th June&lt;/strong&gt; is the provisional date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This will run from midday to 5pm in the Ramgarhia Sikh Sport Centre, Leeds.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As such, we thought we’d follow up, just 4 months later, with some of the exciting developments in Short Track worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, as readers of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://whataboutmagazine.com/"&gt;What A Bout&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; magazine will already know, Short Track Roller Derby has spread further-and-wider than we could have hoped: to Russia, and Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, already. You should read the full article in WAB &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://whataboutmagazine.com/2019/01/20/what-a-bout-issue-3-winter-2019/"&gt;Issue 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for full details, but look out for several Short Track tournaments in Moscow, and other Russian cities later in the year. Dubai’s interest in Short Track has also led to bigger things which we’ll get to later in this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short Track is continuing to enable more teams to play derby, even now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Poland, Gdańsk’s &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/551140512034275/"&gt;Chrome Sirens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; are playing their first ever public game, thanks to Short Track rules enabling them to put together two competitive teams (and use more accessible venues). This double-header event will be coming to the city in the middle of next month - March 16th!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Americas, Short Track Derby is also taking off: ruleset creators Rolla Skate Club having provided initial impetus with a comprehensive series of trial sessions across Canada and the North-west of the USA. In Latin America, meanwhile, there is interest in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in exploring the ruleset, as it solves several of the challenges of the many teams in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":27916,"width":600,"height":426,"linkDestination":"custom"} --&gt;

[not covered by site CC license] )
&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the USA, though, public bouts have already started, with the ruleset enabling teams to play their first games in years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/IVVRD/"&gt;Illinois Valley Vixens Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who played their first public bout for 3 years thanks to Short Track back in February, the ruleset has been a revelation. Whilst some venue issues meant that they had to modify the track slightly, the bout was a complete success - despite only using word of mouth and social media for advertising, they managed to fill all the available seating. Speaking for the league, Lemon Squeezer told us : “We now know that a smaller track definitely does not mean less exciting or intense, quite the opposite! I can't remember a time I have heard a crowd this engaged before and the feedback from spectators was that they are looking forward to the next one and bringing friends. We also had several former skaters come to check it out that are now interested in coming back.”. 
I.M.GROOT added, “The fact that all players have to both jam and block really takes you out of your comfort zone. It pushes you to use all the skills you have learned, not just the ones you prefer. Short Track has the ability to really push skaters to be stronger, better and more adaptable in game play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an even more striking mode, the USA has also brought us the first ever “Short Track” league: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pstrollerderby.com/"&gt;Pittsburgh Short Track Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, founded by a group of skaters who retired from “competitive” Roller Derby, but still wanted to play a friendlier version of the sport. Their league aim, as expressed on their website and Facebook page, “We are a group of friends who wanted to create a safe, stress free environment to get together and skate. Community over competition.” encapsulates the entire point of Short Track as a ruleset and community. (You can find out more about them on social media and their website.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further in the future, there’s also exciting news of potentially the first ever international Short Track Roller Derby Tournament.  The newly created &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/UAERollerDerby/"&gt;UAE All-Stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the United Arab Emirates’ official travel team, are exploding onto the scene, and one of their first public plans is to play Short Track Derby! Formed of skaters from &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/DubaiRollerDerby/"&gt;Dubai Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ADRollerDerby/"&gt;Abu Dhabi Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, the team plan to play all kinds of Derby, but Short Track is definitely a solid component of their goals. [We have more about UAE All-Stars themselves in another new article here, which we’re going to publish soon - and their first ever public game &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/495068457564329/"&gt;will be this weekend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, 2nd March, in Hong Kong, as part of the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the support of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.gogogent.be/en/home-default/"&gt;GO-GO Gent Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who had been investigating hosting an experimental Short Track clinic for several months, UAE All-Stars will be travelling to Belgium on the 1st and 2nd of June. The first day will be a Short Track Roller Derby training workshop, allowing the experienced skaters from Dubai’s testing of the rules (and potentially other skaters who’ve tried Short Track from the rest of Europe) to explain and demonstrate the potential of the ruleset to attendees.  
The second day will be a tournament event: the structure of which is still under development. Teams are welcome to participate from across Europe, and we know that there’s been interest from several regions already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even further in the future, there’s the possibility of Short Track bootcamps in other parts of Europe, including the UK, and other plans afoot about which we can’t speak at this time. Stay tuned for further updates as they occur!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>dubai roller derby</category><category>in the news</category><category>international derby</category><category>international roller derby</category><category>pan-asian spring rollers</category><category>polish roller derby</category><category>short format tournaments</category><category>short track roller derby</category><category>tournament</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/03/01/short-track-worldwide-update-2019-feb/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2019 13:12:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The Slavic Roller Derby Tournament grows into its second year, adds the Baltics!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/08/23/the-slavic-roller-derby-tournament-grows-into-its-second-year-adds-the-baltics/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, we &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2017/08/11/a-slavic-tournament-how-central-and-eastern-european-derby-exploded-in-just-3-years/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reported&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the first ever "Slavic Roller Derby Tournament", a three team round-robin hosted by Warsaw Hellcats, and featuring St Petersburg's White Night Furies, and Prague City Roller Derby B in addition to the hosts. At the time, we noted that the mere possibility of this tournament existing was a signal for just how fast Roller Derby is expanding into Eastern Europe...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...and that expansion has continued into this year, so it is perhaps unsurprising that the tournament is back for a second year this October; bigger and more extensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27274" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/slavic_map_out.png?w=2048" alt="SLAVIC_map_out" width="1024" height="650"&gt; Competitors in Red, except the hosts (in Blue), and the three teams contributing to Team Czech (in Yellow). Men's Derby bout competitors in Black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland have outdone expectations by doubling the number of contenders this time around, and extending the geographical inclusion to the southern Baltic states as well as Slavic nations. Fitting the resulting 6 team round robin into a single day is only possible with non-WFTDA rulesets (15 games would take 15 hours of WFTDA play, not including breaks), so this edition of the Slavic Tournament is being run as with Roller Derby Sevens rules. The reduced maximum roster size of Sevens also makes it more accessible for some of the newer competitors as an additional bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, this added accessibility has allowed several other firsts at this event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riga Roller Derby, representing Latvia, have previous bout experience, as part of the Team Baltic Roller Derby who competed against Team Israel at the 2018 Roller Derby World Cup - but have never played as a team themselves. Their Sevens team will therefore represent multiple firsts here: the first time Riga have competed as a team, and the first time &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; team from the (south) Baltics have competed in a ranked event!
This is very good timing, as the Baltics have just gained their third official league - in Tallinn, Estonia - this week, showing the work done in Riga and Tartu paying off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Team Baltic is not the only connection to the Roller Derby World Cup, as Team Czech Roller Derby will be representing their country in Sevens form, with skaters from Prague's Prague City Roller Derby and Hard Breaking Dolls, joined by members of Roller Derby Brno. Brno's skaters on Team Czech will all be skating in their first public bouts at this tournament, giving them good experience to take back to their league. (We hope that next time Team Czech plays, they can also include skaters from the newly formed league in Ostravia, also announced this week!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-27275" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/08/slavic_czech_map_out.png?w=2048" alt="SLAVIC_CZECH_map_out" width="1024" height="714"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host country Poland will be exceptionally well represented, with not only hosts Warsaw Hellcats, and their fellow Warsaw team, Worst Warsaw, competing, but also Vratislavia (Wrocław)'s MadChix Roller Squad! All three teams have at least several games under their belt, and contributed skaters to Team Poland, (although Warsaw's teams are a lot more experienced!). Additionally, all are particularly used to Sevens tournaments, having competed in the 7th Heaven tournament in Poznań only a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also returning to the tournament from last time are the only bouting team in Russia, St Petersburg's White Night Furies; although they are sending their newer B team, Ingria Rollers, to compete this time around. The Furies also gained a lot of experience from their members in Team Russia at the World Cup this year (as well as their continued participation in the Pohjola Cup), so we're expecting a strong performance from their B Team here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restrictions of Sevens rostering make it difficult to predict the standings of the Slavic/Baltic tournament from FTS records (not least because several of these teams are playing for the first time!), but we'd be unsurprised by strong performances from the hosts, and the composite Czech team. Given the strong tournament experience gained by many of the competitors here in the past year, however, it's hard to rule anyone out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the main event, this edition of the Slavic/Baltic Tournament will also be showcasing two other contests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another debut, this time in men's roller derby: Polish Men's Roller Derby, a collaboration of the Polish Eagles skaters based in Poland itself, play their first game on home soil, ever, against the might of London's Southern Discomfort B, Mild Discomfort!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, finally, a chance to see another fantastic sport on wheels, as Warsaw's Wheelchair Rugby team present their sport in an exhibition game!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/2079168135665222/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;first Slavic/Baltic Tournament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be held on the 20th October in &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/XDcKWPs5wWN2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centrum Sportu Wilanów&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Warsaw, Poland.
