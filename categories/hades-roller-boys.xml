As well as participating in &lt;a href="http://www.britishchamps.com/category/women-local/local-north/"&gt;British Championships Tier 4 North&lt;/a&gt;, they also managed to both host and attend several tournaments, and fly across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, before the Tier 4 fixtures even started, Voodoo had already hosted their own mini-tournament, taking on fellow Tier 4 competitors, New Town Roller Girls, and Glasgow Roller Derby's Cannie Gingers in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/144431299060564/"&gt;Highland Rampage&lt;/a&gt; in Edinburgh's Jack Kane Centre.  While the Cannies emerged victorious, VRD took the win against New Town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VRD also managed to sneak in a battle of the Zombie themed teams, playing Tournai, Belgium's Rolling Zombie Dolls away, and North Wales Roller Derby's Zom Bs at home, before British Champs started in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5609" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/01/11024650_10100359068288294_1208772091011200554_n.jpg" alt="11024650_10100359068288294_1208772091011200554_n" width="960" height="640"&gt; Voodoo Roller Dollies take on New Town for the first time in 2015 (Credit: &lt;a href="http://lauramacd.co.uk"&gt;Laura MacDonald&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between Champs fixtures, Voodoo even took a side trip to Ireland, successfully taking on Belfast City Rockets on the way to a rematch against the East Coast Cyclones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Voodoo failed to earn promotion in British Champs, they also avoided relegation, defeating New Town a second time to stay off the bottom of the table. (VRD are also one of quite a few teams not returning to British Champs in 2016, so that they can concentrate on the rest of their bouting fixtures.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voodoo indulged their love of sur5al in November, sending a team to the Blackpool Roller-Coasters' Sur5al 2015 Mini Tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Dollies capped off the year by hosting their &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/908423505918913/"&gt;second mini tournament&lt;/a&gt; of 2015, with returning Cannie Gingers also taking on Lucerne's Hellveticats in the triple header in Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/HadesRollerBoys/"&gt;Hades Roller Boys&lt;/a&gt; were not letting their sisters in Voodoo have all the fun. At the same time as changing their Facebook page, the Boys started their year in March taking on Bristol's Vice Quads away for a loss, and Cornwall's Scrumpy Old Men for a win the very next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hades followed this up by taking on the impressive Tyne and Fear B in May (as part of a double-header, featuring Newcastle v Brussels), and facing off against Portsmouth's Scurvy Dogs (also as part of a double header, featuring Portsmouth Roller Wenches v Norfolk Brawds) in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hades also love sur5al, and they competed well in both Glasgow Roller Derby's &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1128420117173784/"&gt;tournament&lt;/a&gt; in June, and Leeds Roller Dolls' &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1658884867657678/"&gt;Rolling Dead&lt;/a&gt; in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5612" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/01/12362692_1012007705529392_4768291942966720645_o.jpg" alt="12362692_1012007705529392_4768291942966720645_o" width="2048" height="1365"&gt; Hades take on De Ronnys in the BEARDI final! (Credit: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/orelkichigaiphotography/"&gt;Orel Kichigai&lt;/a&gt; )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important event in Hades' 2015 must be their attendance at the alternative men's European tournament, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BEARDi-1456637027957678/"&gt;B.E.A.R.D.I.&lt;/a&gt; As the only Scottish team attending, Hades had a lot of weight on their shoulders, and they excelled, defeating all comers to make it to the final against Germany's De Ronnys. After a very physical bout, Hades emerged triumphant as 2016 B.E.A.R.D.I. champions!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="p1"&gt;Hades and Voodoo also found the time to fully combine their powers, with &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/HoodooCoedRollerDerby/"&gt;HooDoo Co-ed Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; making their track debut against the "Beach Brawl All Stars" exhibition team. We expect more fixtures for HooDoo this year, as Co-ed roller derby continues to grow in Scotland!&lt;/p&gt;
Finally, 2015 saw the end of an era as two of Voodoo and Hades' founders, Raven and Pete, moved on to other geographical locations. (Raven's last ever bout was also the last bout of the year.)
&lt;p&gt;We'll finish on this message from the current Voodoo Roller Dollies team:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;We would like to say Thank you to Raven and Pete for their contribution to the team and wish them well for the future.
2015 was a very busy year for us and we managed to do more than we even thought we could manage. We are looking forward to 2016 and the opportunities and potential it holds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>hades roller boys</category><category>hoodoo roller derby</category><category>review of the year</category><category>voodoo roller dollies</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2016/01/12/voodoo-and-hades-in-2015/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 16:11:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Spookapolooza: A Very Derby Halloween</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/10/23/spookapolooza-a-very-derby-halloween/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/spookapalooza.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4111" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/10/spookapalooza.jpg?w=614" alt="Spookapalooza" width="614" height="228"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallowe’en weekend sees the Hades Roller Boys have their last bout of the season at the ARC in Glasgow. They’ll be playing host to the boys of Mild Discomfort (Southern Discomfort B) who play for the first time in Scotland. As usual this will be a nail biting, hard-hitting Mens bout. With whistles at 12:15, be sure to buy tickets in advance!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then to top it off the girls of Dundee Roller Girls Rising Stars face off against the Voodoo Roller Dollies in the Dollies last home game of the year. Well worth a watch and tickets are available on the door, but cheaper when bought in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

We thought that, what with having their own exhibition team, founding two others during the year &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; putting on a national tournament, they probably deserved an article to themselves...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/img_0002.png"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3280" alt="img_0002" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/img_0002.png?w=614" width="368" height="553"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Titan and Raven, Into The Nitemare, at the end of Battle of Britain (Copyright: Sam Skipsey)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/img_0001.png"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-3281" alt="Newcastle Roller Girls, winners of BoB." src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/02/img_0001.png?w=614" width="614" height="408"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Newcastle Roller Girls, winners of BoB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This has been an eventful year for Into The Nitemare's derby involvement, with Team Nitemare holding their first exhibition bouts, the formation of Hades Roller Boys and Voodoo Roller Dollies, and the successful hosting of Scotland's second ever national tournament, Battle of Britain. What has been the standout experience for the two of you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve had an amazing year derby wise, and there are far too many highlights to name just one. Team Nitemare was just amazing, I remember welling up at the skateout. Just so proud to see two amazing groups of such talent under one roof. The Jakey Tayzers proved to be a force to be reckoned with and as it turns out, many of them have found themselves on their gender's National Team Scotland. That was also the day of the Hades debut, which was one of the most exciting bouts I’ve had the pleasure of experiencing…I got so wrapped up in the game I have since been sacked as Line Up…by my own husband no less, hehe. I am so not cut out for that position.
The Hades boys put together a charity bout in November, just the week before BoB, which got people coming from all over the UK, and we were chuffed to bits that all these people made such an effort to come, from Manchester Roller Derby, Blackpool Roller Derby League and Belfast Men's Roller Derby, not to mention representation from leagues all over Scotland. It was an amazing day.
Then we get to BoB…well that was a year in the making and we’d again like to pass along our thanks to all that made it possible. We had representation from wider Europe and even the good ole USofA. The only drawback of the day was not skating in it!
As for the Voodoo Roller Dollies, well you’ll have to keep your eyes peeled for our upcoming news but needless to say we’re training hard in preparation for an incredible first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming back to the events in sequence, last time we spoke, we talked about your plans for coed exhibition team, Team Nitemare. This year, they managed to bout for the first time, taking on the Jakey Tayzers for a narrow 174:215 loss and then travelling to play Middlesborough Milk Rollers' Milk Invaders away to a resounding 278:168 win! How was the experience of building to those two bouts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of Team Nitemare is that we have built on it throughout the year and we have expanded our ranks. There were a few hiccups in the the run up to the Jakey Tayzer bout, but in true roller derby fashion, it pulled together and ran smoothly on the day. The Tayzers were a formidable force and showed how well a co-ed team can work together. All of the lead up to the Milk Invaders (Middlesborough Milk Rollers and Teeside Skate Invaders Mash up) was all down to the lovely Terri Sudron and we the team. It was intense in the run up though, especially the first one, it was almost like Christmas, so much tension for an hour or so of watching it all come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team Nitemare's debut was also Hades Roller Boys', the second bout pitting them against Ireland's Men Behaving Derby, for a narrow win. Hades later played Wirral's men's team away in December. This is a bit of a reversal for the two of you, with Raven getting to cheer on Titan[Cronos?] for the first time! Tell us a bit about the experience…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit here, I was a very bad wife and abandoned Titan to go and have fun at Team Scotland Try-outs… The debut is the only bout I’ve seen of Hades, as their next one was over in Montpellier against the Kamiquads.
Although I will be at their next game, most definitely!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A little after Hades was founded, the Falkirk area also gained its third women's team in Voodoo Roller Dollies. With Fierce Valley and Bairn City already in the region, how are Voodoo planning on distinguishing themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set ourselves apart from the two other big teams in the area by being small. We are not looking at expanding to league proportions but our initial aim is to gain a roster of 20. I’ve been a part of a big and fast growing league and found that it wasn’t for me. I like feeling that I know all of my team mates and we speak every day. We aim to conduct the team with as little of the traditional structure as is expected. So if you’re looking to become a new blood at Voodoo, you can expect to have fun , just skate and be a valued member of VRD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Capping off the year for Into The Nitemare was the 6-way Battle of Britain tournament, pitting teams from across the UK (with a few last minute substitutions from the original lineup) against each other. With three teams in the event, Scotland did creditably, with Dundee finishing a strong second after Newcastle's Whippin Hinnies' first place.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;strong&gt; How was the experience of running your first big event? Anything you'd do differently next time [will there be a next time]?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BoB as it was fondly known was a great day. We were so proud to see Scotland do so well, with Dundee rampaging home in silver position, Lothian Representing extremely well on the day despite injury and some brand new skaters and the Belters getting their first win.
Newcastle, having stepped in at the last minute, were valiant in their win, Belfast showing some massive hits and the Reapers playing their first open bouts and getting that first public win under their belts too. The day was fantastic and without the help of Teams, Refs, NSOs, Photographers, Announcers and event staff it would not have been possible. As I said before the nature of derby is to throw a spanner in the works and there were more than a few in the final weeks of preparation with two teams pulling out, venue issues and then on the day a minor mishap with a team bus..but it all came together in the end.
Special mention has to go to Head Ref: Ella Bella Bang Bang (ARRG) and our Head NSO [Crashing] Wookiee [Broken Zebra] (GCRG) without whom, I would have been pretty much a wreck.
Will we do another tournament? Maybe, you’ll just have to wait and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all that happening in 2013, Into The Nitemare must have plans for 2014. Is there anything you can reveal now, or is it all secret?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not secret, but it hasn’t been announced yet. We have a busy year ahead in all aspects, Hades, Voodoo and Team Nitemare , so you’ll just have to watch on the facebooks and twitters to keep abreast of all our happenings!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>battle of britain roller derby tournament</category><category>derby review 2014</category><category>hades roller boys</category><category>into the nitemare</category><category>team nitemare</category><category>voodoo roller dollies</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/02/12/derby-review-2014-nitemare-voodoo-and-hades-and-bob/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2014 19:34:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Wee Raven's 'New Nitemare'</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/09/10/wee-ravens-new-nitemare/</link><dc:creator>feemccartney</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, 15 September at 1:30pm, &lt;a title="Team Nitemare Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamNitemare" target="_blank"&gt;Team Nitemare&lt;/a&gt; will be hosting a double-header bout in Grangemouth Sports Complex. The first bout of the day will see Team Nitemare take on &lt;a title="The Jakey Tayzers Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/jakeytayzers" target="_blank"&gt;The Jakey Tayzers&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a title="Hades Roller Boys Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Hades-Roller-Boys/1387245968162894" target="_blank"&gt;Hades Roller Boys &lt;/a&gt;will come up against &lt;a title="Men Behaving Derby Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Men-Behaving-Derby/260450844088944" target="_blank"&gt;Men Behaving Derby&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h6&gt;So who are the teams?&lt;/h6&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Team Nitemare&lt;/strong&gt; are a group of hand-picked male and female skaters from across the UK, chosen by &lt;a title="Into the Nitemare Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/IntoTheNitemare?fref=ts" target="_blank"&gt;Into the Nitemare,&lt;/a&gt; to represent co-ed roller derby. The double-header this weekend will be their debut appearance!
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Jakey Tayzers&lt;/strong&gt; originated in 2012 when &lt;a title="The Jakey Bites Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheJakeyBites" target="_blank"&gt;The Jakey Bites&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a title="Dundee Roller Girls Website" href="http://dundeerollergirls.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dundee Roller Girls' &lt;/a&gt;Silvery Tayzers chose to join forces in Scotland's first ever co-ed bout against The Silvery Bites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hades Roller Boys&lt;/strong&gt; appeared on the circuit in July this year as a male-only travel team. Similar to Team Nitemare, the skaters in this team originate from all over the UK and have been selected by the team founders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Men Behaving Roller Derby&lt;/strong&gt; are another 'exhibition' team - but their skaters hail from Ireland. Since their inception in February this year, MBRD have been busy recruiting new skaters; this bout will be their first public outing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tickets for the double-header bout are available online from &lt;a title="Buy Tickets Online" href="http://newnitemare.eventbrite.co.uk/" target="_blank"&gt;EventBrite&lt;/a&gt;, priced at £7. Since the Grangemouth Sports Complex is a small venue, they will be sold on a first-come, first-served basis online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see Team Nitemare's &lt;a title="Wee Raven's New Nitemare Facebook Event" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/147236675460398/" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Event&lt;/a&gt; for further details on this double-header bout, or if you have any questions for the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;
