&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I was given the opportunity to speak to Ellie from Glasgow Roller Derby, aka Cheap Skate, about her plans to set up a National Roller Derby Museum in the city. Located in the Women's Library, it would show the history of Scottish and UK derby, featuring items donated by leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, putting together an exhibition taking in that much information was too much for one woman to take on, so Ellie put a call out to other skaters in the hopes that someone could offer some help. One of the people who answered was Auld Reekie Roller Girls' Bint Imperial, known in everyday life as Kirstie Meehan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She explained: "I first heard about the NMRD through an email that Ellie sent to Auld Reekie Roller Girls, in which she discussed its aims and what she wanted it to be, and also asking for donations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm an archivist by profession, so I loved the idea of saving material relating to the early years of roller derby in the UK, so that it wasn't lost. I volunteered to be ARRG's liaison, and I turned up to the launch of the NMRD at Glasgow Women's Library. I met Ellie there, and got asked to co-curate (with Cara Viola and Maulin Rouge of Glasgow Roller Derby) the first exhibition about roller derby in the UK, staged at the GWL."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exhibition at the library has recently finished, but Bint added that she hoped to stay involved with the National Museum of Roller derby, "advising on its future and working with the material".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The NMRD is still in the early stages, but we've already had significant donations of derby-related material from leagues all over the UK, and even from abroad. So the collection - ranging from bout programmes to photographs to costumes and kit - is growing all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We're hoping to continue attracting donations, so that we can build up a historical record of roller derby as it develops in the UK."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the items on display were early bout programmes, derby kit (which Bint assured me had been washed before put in the exhibition!!), photorgraphs and even a film of a jam. The materials have become the property of the Glasgow Women's Library, but, Bint added, it may travel to other locations in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Bint added that she felt the exhibition had helped to raise the profile of the sport. "The reception has been amazing, both from the roller derby community and from the general public. The exhibition we staged at the Glasgow Women's Library was a great success, and raised awareness of roller derby. I'm sure a few people have been inspired to take it up since!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, just because the exhibition is over doesn't mean that there is no more interest in keeping an archive of derby materials that will help flesh out the sport's history for the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The GWL would love to receive more derby-related material from skaters, fans and leagues - if you've got anything you think says something about roller derby in the UK and you don't mind parting with it, contact the lovely archive staff at the GWL. They'd love to hear from you!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>auld reekie roller girls</category><category>bint imperial</category><category>interviews</category><category>national museum of roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/11/16/chronicling-roller-derby/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 16 Nov 2012 13:09:48 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Preserving the history of UK derby for the future</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/08/17/preserving-the-history-of-uk-derby-for-the-future/</link><dc:creator>pandacatkaty</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/08/533405_136106239859192_881727727_n.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2012/08/533405_136106239859192_881727727_n.jpg?w=790" alt="Image"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, I was fortunate to sit down with Cheap Skate, aka Ellie Harrison, a Glasgow Roller Derby skater who has undertaken the task of establishing a UK roller derby museum, with the aim of archiving as much about the sport as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap Skate started skating with GRD in January and instantly became hooked. But for her it was more than just skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It came about as a result of learning about roller derby and as a result of being asked to work with the Women's Library, which has been going for 20 years and is currently based in the Mitchell Library. It's an archive of women's history or things that relate to the history of women. Everything in the library has been donated, so the entire collection is based on this ethos of collective ownership - if everyone donates, everyone feels a part of it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The library, one of two archives dedicated to women's history in the UK, is continuing to thrive and will be moving into its own venue later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the 20th anniversary, Cheap Skate was one of 20 artists invited to work with them, and during her work there, she noticed how much amazing stuff was there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I started to question why people weren't going there," she explained, "and what I could do to help spread the word and make it more inviting to younger women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"All of that was happening at the same time as I was learning about roller derby."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noticing the similaries between the library's collective ownership ethos and derby's "by the skaters, for the skaters" mentality, she realised that it would be a good fit together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I also realised that because it is a new sport, and the people who are doing it are so busy doing it, there is no-one making sure this story is told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistress Malicious, one of the founders, recently officially opened the museum in the library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From bout programmes to merchandise, there is a lot of items being created that run the risk of being lost in the backs of drawers or as committees evolve over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The good thing about the library is that it's an accredited museum and is open to the public."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She added: "Since I've started talking to people about this, I've learned that there's so many people who are archivists or librarians, so that's been a great help."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap Skate said she wanted every league in Scotland, if not the whole of the UK to be represented in the museum, and in an exhibition they are running from the 22nd of September to the 13th of October, called the "Revolution on Roller Skates", curated by GRD and ARRG skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's only really going to grow and realise its potential if people donate and keep it going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Anything relating to leagues in the UK, we want."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The museum will have a stall at Chaos on the Clyde in Kelvinhall on the 25th and 26th of August, where skaters and league members can chat to people from the library and possibly be interviewed and photographed as part of the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Cheap Skate admitted that she would like to see the museum live up to its name, and become the National Museum of Roller Derby, which chronicles all of the UK derby scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I hope that the collection will build and build, and leagues will get used to it being there and want to become a part of the documented history of UK roller derby. It will become valuable for the UK, for Scotland and for the women's library. The collection could then travel and create awareness for the sport and have a life of its own."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any leagues interested in being a part of the museum - and really, why would you not? - can visit &lt;a title="the National Museum of Roller Derby website" href="http://www.nmrd.org.uk" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.nmrd.org.uk&lt;/a&gt; for more details. The museum also has a Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>in the news</category><category>national museum of roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2012/08/17/preserving-the-history-of-uk-derby-for-the-future/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2012 18:20:56 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
