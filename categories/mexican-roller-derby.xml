In this case, the 2019 Mexican National Championships are in Querétaro, and the Brasilian Nationals are in Blumenau. (Plus, of course, this is the weekend of WFTDA's Championships). In addition, the ongoing Finnish and French tournament fixtures recur again this weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;... and there are big tournaments in Kiel, Regensburg, Cambridge, Wiltshire, and Buenos Aires!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[We'd also like to shout out the bout in Japan, for Yokosuka Sushi Rollers versus Kamikaze Badass, and also Tel Aviv Roller Derby's open scrim!]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is busy enough that we're going to have a second, short, Sunday-only update later in the week so we can fit more geographical range in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Plus, more that we've not got space to summarise up here, and you'll have to read down for!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;

With this being the week of Halloween, there's a lot of "spooky" events earlier in the week and on the weekend, but there's some very exciting other developments, including the first internal interleague bout in Uruguay, Liverpool Roller Birds' 10th anniversary, and the Rebellion tournament returning to Melbourne for another year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Even doing that, it's a packed schedule, including: Bologna's Hyenas hosting two days of roller derby at the Ferrara Tattoo Convention, a double header of derby up in Aberdeen, Nantes and Gdańsk both hosting events to celebrate their leagues' respective anniversaries,  a whole sur5al tournament in New Zealand, and a &lt;em&gt;two-track&lt;/em&gt; international tournament in Hull! (And more - the first MRDA-sanctioned triple header in Spain, a weekend of derby in Querétaro... !)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're trying to stick to our rules below, so a lot of events - especially in Australia, which is currently at the height of its Spring events schedule - are having to be missed off the list. (We're open to considering treating very large countries in terms of their constituent States, for the purpose of allowing events, but we'd like the community to let us know how they feel about that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.

Sunday also remains a place for scrimmage, though, with many of these events being more informal affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, remember that there are two open Short Track events this Sunday: the low-contact event in Halifax, and the introduction to Short Track in Worcester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

And, to add to that, this is the weekend of the annual Big Blether Scottish Roller Derby Conference, so all the leagues will be coming together there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also two-day international tournaments in Sweden, the Mexican National Division 2 Championships in Léon, Sudestada Roller Derby's debut bout in Necochea, and more!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

We have two 10th birthdays of leagues, several bootcamps and tournaments (including possibly our favourite one, the Hot Chilli Cup - providing both Junior derby bootcamp and tournament in Australia), and a bunch of exciting derby in Argentina. As there are so many deserving events, we'll be having an addendum to cover significant things in the Sunday-Monday period later in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also switched to a better map projection (Eckert IV) for this edition, to more accurately represent the scale of the countries and continents of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Sunday seems to be the preferred day for things in Latin America, with two events in Bogotá (including a collaboration exercise between 4 of the local leagues), one in Mexico, and the previously mentioned Patagonian bootcamp in run by Vendaval in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK, meanwhile is full of bootcamps and mini-bootcamps for all those not at British Champs over the weekend...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture

Queensland's state tournament has its Grand Final this Saturday; as does British Championships, with their Playoffs deciding the winners in both divisions. There are several leagues celebrating reaching their 1st decade of existence in various ways, an exciting bootcamp in Cancùn, Mexico, and a lot of roller derby in Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, in Scotland, we're raising money to fight cancer with the return of Charity Roller Derby Sevens tournament, Krustfest, for a second year, and in Spain they're holding a Roller Derby festival!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the &lt;em&gt;Scottish&lt;/em&gt; Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've bent the rules a bit this time, because it's important to highlight derby in regions which need more attention, and because it's quiet enough that we have the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).&lt;/p&gt;
