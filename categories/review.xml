However, with a standard WFTDA-rules bout needing at least 90 minutes (and preferably 2 hours) blocked in for it, and around 14+ officials if fully-staffed, hosting large numbers of teams can be tricky, especially if you want a tournament structure capable of providing a "winner".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, there's a huge number of alternative rules for shorter game formats, thus allowing more games per day, and more teams per tournament: from the 2 minute games of Sur5al, through 21 minute Derby Sevens [both with reduced rosters too], through various ad-hoc 30, 40 and 45 minute modifications of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few of the above bout systems change much about the rules of the game beyond timing (and sometimes roster restrictions) - they all take the same number of officials as WFTDA standard games.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Victory or Valhalla&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-26720" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-17-at-12-05-06.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-17 at 12.05.06" width="801" height="792"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/waterfordcityviqueens/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterford City Viqueens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Waterford's oldest Roller Derby league, wanted to promote Roller Derby in their city (and in Ireland) by hosting a 6 team tournament, with teams from across Eire and beyond. For a small league; in this case, just 25 members; hosting a 10 game tournament is challenging not just in terms of time, but also officiating resources. As Macks, for the Viqueens notes, "As Ireland is so small (in general, not just in derby land) securing officials was one of the toughest aspects of organising the tournament, we all know that without them...... THERE IS NO DERBY!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also the Viqueens' first event on this scale, so they also had to work on solving all of the large tournament problems - food, water, changing rooms, scheduling and so on - for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cope with these additional pressures, the league decided to make a more radical choice of ruleset: adopting the &lt;strong&gt;2017 PivotStar Rules&lt;/strong&gt;. To the best of our knowledge, Victory or Valhalla is the first tournament outside of North America where the PivotStar rules have been applied.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;PivotStar Rules&lt;/h4&gt;
The "PivotStar Rules" originated at the 2017 edition of &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/265489690551917/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Best of the West&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Canadian tournament. Tournament sponsors and co-organisers, PivotStar, wanted to provide a more competitive format for large-scale contests, whilst &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; reducing the amount of overhead needed for officials.
PivotStar owner, Luludemon, has explained the reasoning behind the design in more detail on her blog here: [&lt;a href="https://pivotstar.com/best-of-the-west-roller-derby-tournament/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LINK&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;].
&lt;p&gt;The executive summary of &lt;strong&gt;changes&lt;/strong&gt; [and reasoning] might look something like:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20 minute games / no timeouts&lt;/strong&gt; [reduced time / more games]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 point per &lt;em&gt;pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; [reduces load on officials/reduces need for jam referees, reduces "lead jammer advantage"]&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Track cuts relative to track, not opposing players&lt;/strong&gt; [reduces load on officials, keeps game moving forwards]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The reduction of effort provided by the latter two rules changes also allows a reduced number of referees and NSOs: PivotStar suggest having only only &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; referees total per game (two inside and two outside), plus a single "score tracking NSO" to indicate when either jammer has completed a pass, and reduced NSOs in other positions. In testing, Waterford Viqueens determined that they needed a few more officials to help things move smoothly, so their setup assigned two score tracking NSOs (one per team) and an additional NSO for the penalty box timers, for a total of just&lt;em&gt; 11&lt;/em&gt; officials for each game!
&lt;p&gt;The tournament itself, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/339727839871496/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Victory or Valhalla&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was organised as 2 group stages (of three teams each, unseeded), into placement bouts - a single 5th place bout for the lowest teams in each group, and a 4 team single elimination for the top 2 in each group. This gave every team a minimum of 3 games, and a maximum of 4 (for the finalists).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
An obvious effect of the 1 point per pass rule is that scores are a quarter to a fifth as high as equivalent scores from WFTDA rules games of the same duration, as you can see below (Limerick forfeited the final against Belfast, so a bonus game was played between 3rd place (on points) Angoulême and Belfast):

&lt;p&gt;(Other than Belfast topping Limerick (due to Limerick forfeiting), this reproduces the FTS European rankings of the teams competing: these results are not in FTS as yet, as they're non-standard ruleset.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Feedback&lt;/h3&gt;
Any tournament which runs on time and has no major issues is a successful tournament... but how did the attendees react to the new format for Victory or Valhalla?
&lt;p&gt;Waterford City Viqueens performed a survey of attendees to measure just that, and have generously shared a summary of the results with us, on which we base this part of the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all surveys of a population, there are conflicting opinions, with some people praising aspects which others disliked (for example, the summary highlights responses complaining that 20 minute games were a little short, alongside several responses lauding the short games for allowing so many games to be packed into a single day tournament). On a purely qualitative measure, then, response to the PivotStar format might be considered mixed, as skaters mentioning it were either confused by the rules, or, conversely, found them simpler.
(By contrast, officials only &lt;em&gt;positively&lt;/em&gt; mentioned the rules being simpler + more predictable, with complaints more towards the reduction in the number of officials on track.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a more quantitative measure, though, the feeling is &lt;em&gt;unambiguously&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;positive&lt;/em&gt;. Given the chance to rate various aspects of the tournament on a 5 point scale, every single aspect received a mean and median rating between 5 and 4; and no aspect had any 0 ratings at all.
Most promisingly, 100% of responding Skaters and Officials both found the tournament "worthwhile" and said that they would recommend it to others. The Viqueens pulled out a particularly positive quote from one (anonymous) respondent: "Seriously this was a fantastic event and should be a yearly thing. Like an Irish roller con: ye should be really proud of yourselves for pulling it off so well!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=" size-full wp-image-26728 aligncenter" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/05/screen-shot-2018-05-18-at-10-21-36.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-05-18 at 10.21.36" width="540" height="614"&gt; Survey data collated by Waterford Viqueens, made available to us on request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting aspect emerging from the more detailed questions was the not inconsiderable number of officials interested in the tournament primarily &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; of the different ruleset.  22% of officials (compared to 11% of skaters) chose this as their reason, when only allowed to pick a single response. (The majority of skaters prized the ability to compete in multiple games as their reason, 73% of skaters saying so; officials were more split, with no really clear majority out of "location", "multiple games" and "rule set".)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the Viqueens' part, the event was an overall success, both in terms of organisation: "The schedule was reliable and well kept to; we went over time a little before lunch, but the break allowed us to catch up", and in terms of the social effect; "The amount of derby teams was great: people got to meet different teams and play teams they hadn't played before [which] created a great sense of community".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The league, of course, pay tribute to all those necessary for the event to exist, noting that "The announcers were fantastic, [and] the Refs and NSOs did a great job and helped everything run super smoothly".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, media seems to have been the only thing that could be improved, with a Tournament Group Photo one of the things that the league would like to ensure happens next time. (We'd also recommend a group photo for the officials, the announcers, and the volunteers, as well!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to see more tests of the PivotStar Rules elsewhere (with the permission of PivotStar, of course - although we know Luludemon is personally excited to see people using the ruleset in general, it's always nice to ask); and we look forward to more tournaments from Waterford Viqueens in future!&lt;/p&gt;

(We've seen at least three versions of this topic raised in the last couple of months...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, one of the most common answers is: "we use Facebook because getting people to use something else is really hard".
This is true, of course: Facebook's entire raison d'etre is selling access to its community to advertisers, so it's extremely good at finding ways to stop that community leaving it. The problem is that Facebook is also fairly terrible at being a system for managing a league - finding things which didn't happen in the last few days is very hard, and there's few good tools for decision making or project planning.  Additionally, Facebook's policy decisions, in general, are at the whims of their management; the history of Facebook's changes to its social content to improve the advertising revenue, at the cost of service to the user community, is telling.
Facebook Events &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; a pretty good solution for promoting public events - and they're &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than the features in most other social networking sites - but only if your target audience is also on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's the other part of the rub: despite Facebook's best efforts, not everyone has an account on it. Increasingly, especially younger, people - the people your league wants to recruit to grow - are either using other social networks (Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat), or not using social networks at all (just communication tools like WhatsApp). All social networking services "age out" after a while, and becoming dependant on a particular social network for running your league gives you a built-in sell-by date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've previously noted, there's a lot of ethical and philosophical overlap between Roller Derby culture - "For the X, by the X", regardless of if "X" is "Skater", "Member", or otherwise - and the various open culture and consensus democracy movements on the Internet. Luckily, those movements also have built a lot of software for helping organise the various issues communities face...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're going to break down the (software) problems of managing a league (or an NGB, which is really a community of leagues) into a few sections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/2/"&gt;Project Management&lt;/a&gt; (page 2) - the core aspect of running any community with goals - managing who is responsible for them, and how things are going.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/3/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consensus decision making&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 3)  - making decisions that your community can own.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/4/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time &lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 4) - bringing your community into contact with each other, transparently, in discussion.
&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/5/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event &lt;em&gt;Calendaring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 5) - keeping track of time, especially to promote your events to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're not going to talk about "sports club" specific software here, although it does exist. Mostly those tools cover the items on page 2 - Project Management - with a sports-themed emphasis.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Task Management : Taiga, Podio&lt;/h3&gt;
The most important thing that a community with tasks to accomplish needs is a way to track and manage all the responsibilities for making those tasks happen. This is such a common requirement for any community - be it a sporting group, a software development team, a newspaper or a political party, a FTSE100 company... - that there are countless solutions which address this space. Some of these solutions are tied to particular "styles" of project management, and some are more free-form.
&lt;p&gt;As with all of the other solutions in this article, we're going to talk about "hosted" solutions - software which runs on someone else's servers, where they're responsible for all the data you give them - and "self-hosted" solutions - where you run your own service, on servers which you own [this can be actual physical machines, or services in "the cloud"], where you have more control, but also need more technically skilled people to run things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, one of the most popular hosted solutions for project management is &lt;a href="https://podio.com/site/en"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Podio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
As well as project management, Podio tries to be a kitchen-sink solution - also rolling in forums, voting systems and document management - and offers a free trial option (for small teams &amp;lt; 5 members), and a series of paid options (paid per member). We've not used Podio much in anger, but, as with many project management tools with "extras", it seems that the core project management is much better than the things bolted on to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very many free, or open-source solutions in this space as well - open-source communities also need to manage their own tasks, and tend to write their own tools to do so! Out of these options, we currently favour &lt;a href="https://taiga.io/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taiga&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Taiga is more focussed on the task-management aspect of things (although it does do many of the things Podio offers in addition), and prefers solutions in the "agile development" space, which encourages breaking projects up into rapid, incremental goals to allow a team to adapt to changing circumstances. Taiga offers both hosted solutions (free for public projects, paid per member for private projects), and also supports self-hosting - the source code is completely free, so anyone can run their own Taiga server.
The Taiga team also have a handy guide to project management, and Taiga, here: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://taiga.pm/"&gt;https://taiga.pm/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiga and Podio both offer mobile-phone Apps for phone-friendly access, as well as the desktop friendly web interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other good solutions, depending on the Project Management paradigm you like, include Trello and Wrike (both hosted services), and Orchard Collaboration (an open-source, self-hosted solution). There are also several app-only services aimed specifically at running sports clubs, but these seem to be vexingly limited and are usually pay-only. One of the best of the sports club solutions seems to be &lt;a href="https://teamstuff.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TeamStuff&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which, despite being a hosted closed-source solution, does have a free option with most of the features you'd want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Consensus : Loomio&lt;/h3&gt;
In order to drive your community's priorities, you need to make decisions which involve your whole community. Hierarchical cultures will make decisions from "on top", whilst more open, "democratic", communities will involve the membership in all decisions, from "bottom up".  The project management software from the previous page will often allow for both styles, but tend to focus on adversarial voting systems to do "democracy".
&lt;p&gt;Generally,  the best approaches to community decision making tend to be Consensus, not direct voting; approaches whereby the community &lt;em&gt;negotiates&lt;/em&gt; a mutually acceptable solution for any given problem, collaboratively, rather than adversarially.
Consensus approaches for government are pretty widespread in many cultures in the world, from the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) through to the Religious Society of Friends (the Quakers). They've not caught on as much in Western-style mainstream politics, where adversarial voting systems are more common, and the "minority loses absolutely" mindset can be difficult to shake, even when relatively minor compromises could improve solutions for everyone. Majority votes easily split communities, and can be a big source of frustrations and feelings of disenfranchisement for those in the minority (especially if that minority is large, or if the "majority" is less than 50% itself)*.
We know that many leagues adopt consensus style systems to make decisions - but many also don't, and it's definitely worth considering them if your league uses adversarial voting and has strong tensions due to minority votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use software to help you make decisions by consensus, then you will probably need to use a separate service to your project management solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best Consensus decision-making application we're aware of is &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loomio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
A product of the Occupy movement, and run by a self-owned community, Loomio provides both a hosted option (you can sign up for accounts on the Loomio website and use it right away, with free and paid options - including a very discounted paid option for non-profits), and also options for hosting your own copy on your own servers (the code is, of course, entirely open-source, and therefore compatible with the community spirit of roller derby). Loomio has become increasingly widely-used by communities at all scale, even national governments - the &lt;a href="http://blog.loomio.org/2016/05/16/national_assembly_wales/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welsh Assembly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loomio also provides mobile-phone friendly interfaces to allow you to interact easily on whatever device you have, although there's no "App" per se.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can read about how the Loomio Collective embodies the same spirit as Roller Derby does, and the way they structure themselves to support this in their freely available handbook: &lt;a href="https://loomio.coop/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://loomio.coop/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; , and read their free, and open-source guide to Consensus and Facilitation here: &lt;a href="https://www.loomio.school/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;https://www.loomio.school/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*This is as true in countries as it is in smaller communities - we're sure readers can point at several contentious political decisions in the recent past where "narrow victories" led to the absolute acceptance of the "winning" position with no compromise, and resulting anger from all sides.
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Community Communication : Mattermost, Riot.IM&lt;/h3&gt;
Every community benefits from a place to just, well, communicate. Whilst Loomio, and project management tools, all provide a way to discuss things, modern communities are used to freeform, rapid, social messaging. (Ironically, this also used to be the case with earlier internet cultures, who used IRC for precisely this, so this is something of a re-invention of an old concept.) Having one of these communication services absolutely is not a replacement for a proper decision making system, or a project management tool - for the same reason that Facebook is awful for project management: finding things in a long, stream of consciousness history, 6 months later, is almost impossible. However, rapid communication is definitely essential "in the moment", and to bind together your other services with your community itself.
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the current "mainstream" solution for real-time comms seems to be &lt;strong&gt;Slack&lt;/strong&gt;, that product has several limitations which make it less than ideal for large volunteer communities. For a start, Slack is closed-source; and there's no way to run your own separate version of the service - all your data is on Slack's servers, and subject to Slack's rules.
Additionally, the balance of features between the Free and Paid tiers of service is not particularly good, especially regarding retention of logs - it's very easy to hit the "max 10,000" messages limit and then start losing your league's history of communication.
Finally, because of that very closed-source, hosted-only solution, Slack has the balance of power in your relationship with it - very recently, they've started&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://opkode.com/blog/slacks-bait-and-switch/"&gt;turning off features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; which allow you more flexibility in using their service, as part of the usual pattern to achieve vendor lock-in in the tech industry. Having to rely on your service being a good-guy, all the time, is not a good place to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the open-source movement has our backs, and there are many alternatives to Slack which are just as good, if not better, ethically and performance-wise. We will only mention two here, as examples of the rest of the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.mattermost.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mattermost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provide a Slack-like series of options (free, paid, and "even more expensive paid"), but you need to &lt;em&gt;host&lt;/em&gt; your own server running the software. Of course, the free version of Mattermost is open-source, and does not have most of the limits of the free version of Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.riot.im/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riot.IM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provide a hosted solution which is currently totally free for every feature (they are planning paid hosted options, but it's been a year without any appearing); they're also a completely open-source solution which you can host yourself. [Technically, Riot.IM is a front-end to a messaging system called Matrix, which is also open-source and free.] At present, the "free" Riot.IM hosted instance seems to be having some performance problems, but we believe that this is temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-26484" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-07-at-22-22-36.png?w=1024" alt="Riot.IM" width="1024" height="1009"&gt; A test room in Riot.IM (all of these chat systems look near identical, and much like chat systems always have done since the 1990s).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Mattermost and Riot.IM support Slack-compatible "integrations" - allowing your Loomio consensus discussions, and your project management tool, to send notifications and messages to your chat rooms, reminding your community of decisions to be made, or tasks which need to be performed. (The Loomio integration even lets you respond directly from the notification!) With both sets of integrations turned on, your chat channel can be the social "glue" which binds your decision making and your project management together.
Mattermost and Riot.IM also both offer mobile Apps for phone-friendly access, which are just as good as Slack's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Mattermost and Riot.IM (and other alternatives like RocketChat etc) are both open-source, and provide self-hosting solutions, they are very unlikely to try (or succeed at) the same vendor-lock-in approaches which Slack is currently attempting. We'd strongly recommend that leagues look at any of the Slack alternatives with open-source options just for this reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/5/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event &lt;em&gt;Calendaring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (page 5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Community Event Calendaring: Google Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final thing that any league needs is a way to keep track of events, and to promote the public ones to the world. This is really two problems: a calendar, and "social media suite".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ironically, promoting public events is something that Facebook itself is actually fairly good at, as we mentioned at the start of the article - as long as your community is all on the platform (which they increasingly are not).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more open-access calendaring and event promotion, there are relatively few truly "open" services. The problem with "promotion" is, of course, that you do need an audience and a way to push your things at them. In the past, this was handled by common services - like RSS - which could be "subscribed" to by interested people, who would then get updates. In the present, your calendaring service needs to be able to be promoted on all your social media platforms, which (given the increasing fragmentation of the market) is much harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One &lt;em&gt;hosted&lt;/em&gt; service which does work pretty well for this - and has less lock-in than Facebook - is &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Obviously, Google is not the most "grass-roots" of providers - and they have a disappointing track record in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Discontinued_Google_services"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;turning off services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at little notice. However, their Calendaring service is one of the more used of their core products, so it's a slightly safer bet for longevity than some of their other products. Google Calendar is also used as the "backend" for many other applications which manage schedules and events for users.
In itself, Google Calendar handles the calendar part of things pretty well, and for free (Google, like Facebook, get money from having data about you, and pushing ads at you). A Google Calendar event is inherently public, and can be linked to by you from anywhere, without the viewers needing a login.
&lt;a href="https://zapier.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zapier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ifttt.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IFTTT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the two most popular "app automation services", fully support the "social media" side of things - they can be set up to automatically share a public calendar event on any and all social media platforms you have logins for. (They also have integrations for Mattermost to post things in your public chat, and several of the Project Management applications - like Trello and Wrike - can add things to a Google Calendar for you automatically.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the other side of things, there are a whole suite of applications to share things across social media with the click of a button, most of which are paid, hosted services - ranging from the relatively affordable (Loomly, Hootsuite, etc), to the ridiculously expensive and "professional" (Kapost, Percolate and others). The more expensive of these offer huge ranges of services to schedule promotional posts across whole suites of social media profiles and platforms... your league probably already has their social media team using whatever their favourite tool is (and it's probably Hootsuite). Most of these can integrate with a lot of the tools from earlier sections (including your communication service), and can draw items from Google Calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the technically minded people in your league, we'd actually recommend &lt;strong&gt;hosting your calendar yourselves&lt;/strong&gt; on your website, and linking people there across all your social media accounts. (You can make Facebook Events and Google Calendar entries to match it, of course, but owning your data on your website gives you more control and freedom).  If you do this, please do turn on the RSS (or Atom) feed, as it's a very cheap and open way to provide updates to your schedule for anyone who wants to subscribe.* This also frees you from needing to rely on third-party services like Zapier, as you can push your social media notifications directly from your server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Our weekly event roundups for the world mostly draw from Facebook Events as a pragmatic acceptance that that's where leagues advertise things [and we prefer that to the growing trend of leagues just posting an flyer on Instagram, which doesn't help syndication at all].... but being able to subscribe to RSS feeds would also make our lives easier ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--nextpage--&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;BONUS: Community Forums: Discourse&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whilst we've covered the most popular modern means of communication in the &lt;a href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2018/03/22/roller-derby-and-open-consensus-software/4/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time &lt;em&gt;Communication&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; section, some leagues may also want to host a more static discussion.
Whilst project management software, and Loomio, provide discussion threads as part of their service, there can be some benefits to running a separate Forum, in addition to your real-time discussion rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, you will want to self-host your own forum software, as the hosted services are not that great. There is a wide range of, mostly open-source, forum software to choose from, and our recommendation here does not mean you shouldn't go for one of the alternatives.
However, since we have to recommend at least one solution for each topic, we will be suggesting &lt;a href="https://www.discourse.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discourse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
Discourse is, unlike most of the other forum software, written in Ruby, and has a very responsive Javascript powered interface. Whilst overuse of Javascript in webpages is definitely a security issue in itself, Discourse benefits significantly in usability compared to older forum software which has a less responsive design.
Discourse also offer a hosted solution, although it's rather expensive ($100 a month!). We'd definitely recommend using their container-based self-hosting solution in preference to this, just for the cost-saving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In common with the software in many of the other section, Discourse also provides a number of "integrations" with other services - a chat integration so your real-time chat can be notified of new topics, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

Moving a little further North than the last few, Silvery Tayzers Captain Psychomilly was happy to talk about &lt;a href="http://dundeerollergirls.com/"&gt;Dundee Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;' year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/01/img_0341-copy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-3158" alt="Dundee Roller Girls taking on Lothian Derby Dolls at Battle of Britain (Photo: Laura MacDonald)" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/01/img_0341-copy.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Dundee Roller Girls taking on Lothian Derby Dolls at Battle of Britain (Photo: Laura MacDonald)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compared to 2012, 2013 has been a slightly more mixed year for the Silvery Tayzers; a couple of losses at the start of the season against Rainy City and Glasgow's Maiden Grrders, followed by an improving streak (a narrow loss against Newcastle's Whippin' Hinnies, and an almost unbroken winning streak since). You said last year that Dundee were aiming higher for their competition in 2013; how did you work to raise your game and fight back over the year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team has worked really hard this year to push our skills and to keep our tactics current with the new rules set introduced. We saw more losses this year than last, but we really were playing with the big girls this year! Over the year I think we settled into our new roster and became more comfortable working together as a team. In the latter half of the year, we took our tactics back to basics and worked on developing our skills together, which definitely paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's also been several changes to the roster over 2013, starting the season with several regulars missing or moved to other locations, and then Suffra-Jet moving to Glasgow to join GRD in the middle of the year, and Cult Friction moving to Edinburgh to join ARRG (and changing her skatename!), ending with Dr Carnage's last bout You've also picked up a bunch of new (or returning) skaters, who we saw in the last few bouts of the year. How are you adapting to the changing makeup of Dundee this year? Do you think this kind of cyclic mutability is good for the team?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRG have always had a pretty fluid roster as we're a university team - there's two universitys in Dundee, but it's a small city when it comes to finding a job, so a lot of our veteran skaters have moved for the sake of their careers. It's always hard to see someone you've trained with leave, but we're so, so proud of everyone who has moved on and become even more skilled.
This season, we've had some absolutely inspirational skaters move from newbies to Tayzers almost seamlessly. Having so many new skaters get on the Tayzer's roster has meant that as a team we've worked even harder to bond on track and to support each other. BoB and our home game against FVRG were the most 'together' I felt the team all year and it's a total pleasure to skate with so many committed new skaters. I think having new skaters move up to the Tayzers is good for us as a team - they bring fresh ideas and their enthusiasm and motivation is infectious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With all the preparation for the second ever (Women's) Roller Derby World Cup in 2014, several of Dundee's skaters have been trying out for national teams. Crazily InSanne got into Team Netherlands, and there's a few of your skaters who attended the Team Scotland first round tryouts. It's a great thing for Scottish derby to have skaters featured in potentially multiple national teams… do you see more of this and other international involvement in Dundee's future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm so excited to see DRG represented at the World Cup. Sanne has gone from strength to strength this year and I think you'd struggle to find someone more committed to the sport. Her behind the scenes work to keep our team running as well as the time she spends honing her skills, fitness and knowledge is outstanding. It'd be a total dream to represent DRG as part of Team Scotland, but the competition is so, so high!
I'd love to see Dundee more involved in international derby, particularly now that there's more and more leagues in Europe visiting Scotland. Hopefully this year we can experience our first international bout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking outside of Dundee, there's been a continuing growth in Scottish Roller Derby over 2013, with Bairn City Rollers, Lothian Derby Dolls and New Town Roller Girls all holding their first bouts this year. Dundee played two of those league already, and donated a skater or two to New Town's cherry popping bout roster. Now that Dundee is firmly in the upper-half of Scottish teams in terms of experience, do you feel you have a responsibility to newer teams? How does the increasing breadth of derby spread interact with how you see DRG placing itself in Scotland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion of derby in Scotland this year has been amazing. We've found the newer leagues have provided a great opportunity for some of our newer skaters to get involved with scrimmages and bouts with skaters of their level. We've also seen skaters from a lot of the newer leagues in Scotland visiting us for our open scrimmages, which is a really good way of sharing learning and techniques, as well as getting to know the leagues better. In the beginning, DRG received so much training and advice from the larger leagues at the time, we realise how important it is to be supported by more experienced teams. We love to help out other leagues in any way we can!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This was the first year Dundee Roller Girls played in a tournament, signing up to IntotheNitemare's Battle of Britain at the last minute due to cancellations. Despite Newcastle pipping you to the top spot, Dundee did very well - are you planning on more tournaments after this experience? How did the tournament compare to the usual single-bout context?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'd love to take part in more tournaments. It's a fantastic way of bonding as a team and I think we kept the momentum going throughout the day. I couldn't have been any more proud to captain DRG at the tournament. We worked together so well as a team - particularly with 6 skaters new to the Tayzers. BoB was one of my favourite experiences in derby.
I think tournaments differ to single bouts in that it's over just as you get into your stride. Keeping the motivation and morale up through the day was really important to us - we had a team quiz, a poster of the roster made up of pugs and a gold-star system of goals to keep us all focused and smiling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For much of this year, Dundee have continued their support of Co-ed Derby with the Dundee Co-ed Scrims continuing to be extremely popular for skaters across Scotland, and the Jakey Tayzers returning to play more co-ed derby on track. How's Dundee's relationship with Co-Ed developed over the year? Will the Jakey Tayzers remain a more exhibition team, or is there possibility of a more formal arrangement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dundee have always supported co-ed derby and will continue to do so. This year we've moved to having monthly co-ed scrimmages. Co-ed is a great way to challenge ourselves, as skating with men means we have to skate that little bit smarter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the Jakey Tayzers...I think we already see ourselves as more than an exhibition team. Still unbeaten!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a personal note, you’ve had a busy year: referreeing at as many bouts as you’ve played in, appearing on Team Steve for Scotland’s first Men v Women bout against the Jakey Bites, as well as regaining the captaincy of Dundee for the last bouts of the season (and trying out for Team Scotland(!)). How do you fit it all the derby in? Is there a temptation to choose one or other of refereeing or bouting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been really lucky over the past few years, with ARRG and GRD giving me the opportunity to officiate loads of their bouts, including my first WFTDA Sanctioned bouts, which was a total honour. I also loved reffing the Men's European Roller Derby Champs. It was an incredible experience and I met loads of really inspirational officials. I'm also lucky to have such a supportive home league who've given me the opportunity to captain them again and help build the team and I've had the most fun bouting with them this year, especially at Battle of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My heart is definitely still in bouting, I love DRG, though I do often get told that I'll have to choose either skating or officiating eventually. I find that a really strange idea and one that I think only female officials seem to be pushed into - I can think of a number of male skaters who skate high level derby who also officiate, but women in the same situation seem to be expected to choose one or the other. Until my schedule means I can't manage both, I'm happy sharing my time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, can you let us in on any of Dundee Roller Girls' plans for 2014?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hmm...well, we have a massive year planned for the team, but sadly I can't reveal too much just yet! It's safe to say we're working hard to expand and develop our wee team, so watch this space!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>derby review 2014</category><category>drg</category><category>dundee roller girls</category><category>interviews</category><category>review</category><category>silvery tayzers</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/01/14/derby-review-2014-dundee-roller-girls/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 14 Jan 2014 11:49:53 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
