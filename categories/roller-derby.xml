&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, the WFTDA announced that they were dramatically slimming down the "post-Season" for this year, and the effects continue today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last hour, the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://mrdwc.com"&gt;Men's Roller Derby World Cup&lt;/a&gt; announced that they had decided to take the sad step of cancelling the current date for the 2020 MRDWC in St Louis, in favour of a booking some time in 2021. As this is a postponement, we assume that the MRDWC 2021 will be in the same place, and hopefully will have the same teams... just in a different year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, with the near-global hiatus in team training, not to say opportunities for Officials to keep up their practice, no-one can say what Roller Derby will look like even in a year's time. Roller Derby is also sensitive to non-sport specific issues which affect all volunteer communities - the expected increase in unemployment, and other economic impacts, is likely to affect the sport worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the converse side, the extra time and delay may also allow some teams which dropped out of contention for the 2020 MRDWC time to regroup and reapply. MRDWC is being open about allowing such teams an opportunity to rejoin the competition for its 2021, if they wish to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full text of the MRDWC announcement is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;---&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have come to a decision. We will be postponing the St. Louis MRDWC indefinitely, with a target date of March/April 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our reasoning:
First, no one wants to cancel. We all want to skate. This is our best option for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, although the venue is perfect for our purposes, they cannot yet commit to a date. They will let us know in a few months, which is why we need to leave the date open for now. We may be able to announce the date before July, and indeed we hope so. Our host is working with the venue to make this happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that this offers you the ability to plan, to recover costs or move bookings, and to refocus on keeping yourselves and yours healthy and safe. The host hotel will cancel all bookings for this event in a few days for those who booked with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See you all around the track...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, though, it's still a bit negative, as the WFTDA announced the cancellation of Playoffs and Continental Cups this season. With the ongoing effects of COVID-19 responses across all of the competitive regions in which Roller Derby happens, it was inevitable that the competitive season would be at least strongly truncated - with it unlikely that we'll see anything like a semblance of "normal training" before June, it's clear that expecting teams to launch back into the WFTDA Sanctioned competition would be unrealistic (to say nothing of the expectations this would place on Officials and Volunteers)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As far as possible, the hosts will be hosting the equivalent events in 2021, with WFTDA support for the impacts of this on the leagues.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the Rankings Committee and Competitive Play Committee have made continual adjustments to try to allow the rankings system to support teams, it's sometimes necessary to also cut back the schedule itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WFTDA &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; still planning a "Championships" event in November, although we would imagine that the nature of this will be strongly dependent on upcoming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full WFTDA statement can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://resources.wftda.org/3-30-20-covid-19-statement-and-update/"&gt;https://resources.wftda.org/3-30-20-covid-19-statement-and-update/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cancellations</category><category>covid19</category><category>international roller derby</category><category>roller derby</category><category>tournaments</category><category>wftda</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/04/WFTDA-COVID19/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>COVID-19 and Roller Derby</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/COVID19/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard not to be aware of the effect that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is causing on all human activity, globally, and Roller Derby is not exempt. COVID-19, the disease caused by
SARS-CoV-2, is stretching the health services of several nations. In order to control its spread, an increasing number of internal and external travel and gathering restrictions are being applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Italy and China, where all non-essential gatherings are currently banned, Roller Derby has stopped along with everything else. The Chinese leagues have not been able to practice since the lockdown in their
country in February (with restrictions now slowly being lifted); in Italy since the increasingly escalating actions in the last week or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increasing number of tournaments are now beginning to cancel. In Italy, the Anguanas' March and April Sanctioned triple-headers have been cancelled; but even in countries with less internal restrictions, there are cancellations. Copenhagen Ladybugs have had to cancel their upcoming Sevens extravaganza due to the Danish advice, for example; and there are a host of cancellations across the continental USA, despite their government's lacklustre response to ongoing events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are yet to see changes to the status of the Men's Roller Derby World Cup or Rollercon, both highly-international events this year, but given the breaking news restrictions placed by the US President on travel from Schengen countries in Europe, it seems increasingly likely that there will be &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; knock-on effect. (They are both scheduled far enough in the future that it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt; that we could have a pandemic peak before they happen; but once an infectious disease goes pandemic, it becomes much harder to eradicate quickly.) [Edited after initial publication to note: MRDWC have announced that they will be following all local and international advice; but this has not yet resulted in an actual change to their schedule.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://resources.wftda.org/covid-19/"&gt;WFTDA&lt;/a&gt; has published risk-management guidelines for reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections if you do hold public games during this period. They essentially reduce to the usual advice that minimising physical contact, and maintaining proper hygiene standards is the most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus, along with recommendations to cancel non-essential events and follow your country's own guidelines and restrictions. (As with other examples of force majeure, WFTDA will not penalise members for cancelling Sanctioned events due to public health concerns around COVID-19.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're hoping to chat to some of the most affected regions and at least help keep their Roller Derby in the public eye a bit, even if they can't play...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but if you want to help track all the effects on Roller Derby (or just see the results of this), we're linking to Axis of Stevil's &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mZhFN7i7s1vTUCE5g0gfy_YqFNDaUq0sAvWhI0nT1so/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;public Google Doc&lt;/a&gt; for this purpose. Stevil is part of WFTDA's "COVID19 Taskforce", who are working in managing the response to the pandemic and its medical and political effects relating to the sport and its participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>cancellations</category><category>covid19</category><category>epidemiology</category><category>international roller derby</category><category>oronaviruses</category><category>roller derby</category><category>statistics</category><category>tournaments</category><category>training</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/03/COVID19/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Mar 2020 07:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Derby Drama: Role Playing Roller Derby</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2020/02/DerbyDrama2020/</link><dc:creator>SRD</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This document is licenced CC:BY-SA 4.0, the authors are Libby Horacek and Sam Skipsey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst they might seem superficially different, Roller Derby and Role Playing Games have a surprising amount in common, including having experienced more than one resurgence of popular interest driven by pop cultural reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Roller Derby has &lt;em&gt;Whip It&lt;/em&gt;, and now &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;; RPGs (and especially their most famous example, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons), have appearances in &lt;em&gt;E.T.&lt;/em&gt; (and their own cartoon) in the 80s and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; in the present day, as well as increasing popularity through “actual play”, role playing game campaigns streamed live, or recorded, on Twitch, YouTube or as podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Libby Horacek has made the, perhaps obvious in retrospect, step of connecting the two, via an RPG set in the context of Roller Derby itself… a game of tactics on track and management and feelings off track, which can only have one name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="derby-drama"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://derbydrama.com"&gt;Derby Drama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img alt="The Derby Drama kickstarter logo" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2020/02/derbydrama_original.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at SRD we like both Roller Derby and RPGs, and we know that there’s a huge crossover between D&amp;amp;D players and skaters, so we thought it was worth catching up with Libby to talk about all things Derby, RPGs and anything else, starting with how this all started for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby has changed a lot since the revival in 2001; with age, and with the changing of the wider cultures in which it’s embedded, it's grown, shrunk, formalised, organised, reorganised, liberated and moderated in various ways in various places. We’ve gone from being some friends who skate together and have fun to being a sport with World Cups and World Championships, leagues on six continents and a growing Junior reach (all whilst still having fun).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The UKRDA logo, on a folded banner." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/UKRDA-1.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UKRDA, like all of the Roller Derby “National Governing Bodies” has been part of that journey, but the role of National Governing Bodies hasn’t always been clear in our new and rapidly evolving sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2007, the group that would become UKRDA was nothing more than a Yahoo groups discussion board (some readers may not even remember that Yahoo ran such a service!); a place for the fifteen active leagues to coordinate, share advice, and work together to see how this Roller Derby thing could happen. Two years later, it had gone formal: naming itself the “United Kingdom Roller Derby Association”, to provide a democratic body that could represent the sport to all those structures that need an “organisation” to talk to. Slowly, as Roller Derby in the UK has grown, the UKRDA has evolved, taking on more responsibilities.
(To name a few: overseeing National Teams for the World Cups; supporting the development of British Championships; negotiating in a position of collective strength for insurance for leagues; managing grievances and complaints; upholding codes of conduct; standing up for leagues when they need support; supporting officials in development and training; and representing the sport to National and International media.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past month, it has taken another step, joining the German and Finnish NGBs in formalising a deeper relationship with the WFTDA. This collaboration may look like a simple letter, but the significance is so much more. In the face of other organisations, such as World Skate, who want to be seen as the leaders of roller derby, we say no. We acknowledge that this sport, our sport, is run by those that make it; the officials, the volunteers and the skaters. For this to continue to be the case, we have to put these procedures and agreements in place. These are important foundations, we're building a platform of NGBs working together with our global governing bodies - it's giving NGBs a clear voice in the future of our sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these significant changes and developments, the UKRDA continues to be a small team of volunteers. These volunteers are elected by member leagues and are governed by votes of those leagues. At times the UKRDA has been perceived as a "faceless bureaucracy", but in its simplest form, it is a group of volunteers who care deeply about the progression and development of Roller Derby. Our names are available on our website, we're real people who skate, volunteer and officiate at leagues across the UK. However, in the past year, online abuse and pressure have made the job even harder for this band of volunteers. We’ve heard more from people sending us abuse, than those wanting to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a crucial time for UK roller derby. The last 6 months, (or even 7 days!) have proved the value of clear, agreed on policies available for leagues as well as the importance of grievance and escalation processes. But we can’t do this alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have big plans. But we need more people to come on board to see these plans through. One of the priority projects for the UKRDA is to seek recognition from the Sports Councils across the UK as an NGB in our right - we can tap into structures, advice, support and potentially funding. We also need to review our grievance process to help ensure safe spaces. We want to foster the development and learning of officials through boot camps. We want to develop a UK wide safeguarding policy for roller derby that leagues can implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need you to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is only so much a few people can do. You have the expertise of your sport, your leagues, your local areas. We need you to help us make all of these structures better, to support our sport and the people within it as well as we should. We're here being open and honest; the culture and actions towards URKDA need to change, and we need to change - this is where we need you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nominations for people to join the board of the UKRDA are open now. Without you, this won’t happen. We are only as strong as our member leagues and our volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have an Extraordinary General Meeting on &lt;strong&gt;October 3rd&lt;/strong&gt; - if your league is a member we want you to be there. All of us make up the UKRDA, but more of us need to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK roller derby scene is amazing. We are writing this while at British Championships playoffs, at the end of the first day when we have seen the level of commitment and skill from leagues that ten years ago would have been visible at a WFTDA D1 team. The athleticism, the energy, the passion is there.  We're so proud to be a part of this incredible sport, and we hope this has given you an insight into our commitment to its development, and that we have heard what our members want. This is a step towards achieving that.&lt;/p&gt;

If you have something you want to say about Roller Derby, then we're happy to work with you to say it - as we have, for example, with Vendaval Roller Derby just this week. Vendaval contacted us to work on this article, and we thought that it was important enough to share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next few weeks, we're hoping to have a few more guest articles - written entirely by others - as well some features and catchups on more exciting events across the world, returning to some of the national tournaments we covered last year, and some new events for this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we're always open for more articles: we'd like to help amplify the voices of the entire roller derby community, regardless of the language they speak, the country they're in, or the divisions they play in. So, please, get in touch with us, by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.facebook.com/scottish.rollerderby/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="mailto:scottishrollerderby@gmail.com"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/scottishrollerderby/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; message; or even WeChat (we can't link to WeChat directly) or WhatsApp. (We're thinking about a VK account, but don't have one yet.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>roller derby</category><category>we need you</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/WeNeedYou/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Sep 2019 12:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Beijing's Dragon Bootcamp - the start of an annual tradition!</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/07/rollerderby-bei-2019/</link><dc:creator>aoanla</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roller Derby in China, and Asia in general (outside of Japan) has always been a widely dispersed community, with initiatives like the Pan-Asian Spring Rollers helping to tie the region together, and share resources sustainably. However, there've been relatively few big "all-day all-round" bootcamps in the region, and, in particular, little for the officiating side of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it was particularly exciting to hear that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://beijingrollerderby.weebly.com/"&gt;Beijing Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; was hosting a 1-day multi-discipline bootcamp over the Dragon Boat Festival Weekend (8 June) this year. Skaters from all three Chinese-region leagues - Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong - were present, for the all day event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer logo for the Beijing Dragon Bootcamp event." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/07/Beijingbootcamplogo.jpg"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked to a few of the attendees for feedback on the event, which included everything from Skate maintenance and "what is Roller Derby", all the way through drills, communication skills, and a final modified-&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track&lt;/a&gt; rules scrimmage.&lt;/p&gt;

On August 18th, they will be taking on Granite City's Fight Hawks at Grangemouth Sports Complex.
&lt;p&gt;This is the Belters' first game since early 2017 and sees a few changes to their team. Whilst some skaters have moved on or retired, the Belters have also had some new faces join their squad, including a couple of familiar faces that used to play elsewhere in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fight Hawks had a great year in 2017, winning all five of the games they played. Now in 2018 they already have 3 games under their belt, the most recent a close bout against Dundee Roller Derby's Bonnie Colliders last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glasgow’s own Mean City Roller Derby will welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to the town for a showdown soundtracked by everyone from Oasis and The Stone Roses to New Order and The Smiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Mean City be feeling ‘Supersonic’ with their ‘Wonderwalls’ or will the Chaos Engine skaters be ‘Made of Stone’? We’ll find out on Saturday April 25 at the ARC sportscentre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a very special occasion as Mean City will be joining forces with friends Glasgow Roller Derby to host a double-header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on the bill will be Glasgow Roller Derby’s Cannie Gingers who will be playing Team Metal Legs – a select squad made up of skaters who have suffered and subsequently overcome breaks during the derby career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means fans will be treated to two full games for the price of one – an all-male game and an all-female game – showcasing some of the silkiest skills and high-octane thrills that this wonderful sport has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan Muir, Chair of Mean City Roller Derby, said: “I hope as many people as possible come along to the ARC on April 25 – it’s a great opportunity to get to know this wonderful sport, enjoy some groovy tunes and meet some of Scotland’s friendliest skaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s no ‘Definitely Maybe’ about it – April 25 is going to be a fantastic celebration of spills, thrills and derby-aches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Get your ticket now – we’ll sell you a full seat, but you’ll be perched on the edge of it when these four teams take to the track.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alan added: “We can’t wait to welcome Manchester Roller Derby’s Chaos Engine to town – they are great league and a fantastic group of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And we’re delighted to be hosting a double-header as our good friends at Glasgow Roller Derby take on the magnificent Team Metal Legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Come along with all the family – there will be refreshments, merchandise and more on the day too. To quote The Stone Roses - it's ‘What the World is Waiting For’!”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Mean City Roller Derby vs Manchester’s Chaos Engine and Glasgow Roller Derby v Team Metal Legs takes place on Saturday April 25 – from 11.30am at the ARC sportscentre, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow, G4 0BA.&lt;/li&gt;
