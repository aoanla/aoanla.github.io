&lt;p&gt;Since 2010, Perú has hosted Roller Derby in the form of its only league, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/toxiclimarollerderby/"&gt;Toxic Lima Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; . We have been lucky enough to be able to talk to one of their longer-standing members, Twerkin Pony, about the history, and present, of Roller Derby in Perú.&lt;/p&gt;

There are exciting things to write about, across the world, as well, so we'll break this up region by region! Because of the prevalence of Facebook (and the fact that its Events are one of the few useful things about it), all links to events will be there; but we'll include enough info for you to get to the event without needing anything owned by Mark Zuckerberg. Where possible, we link to league websites, or to their Instagram when it isn't.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/vendavalrollerderby/"&gt;Vendaval Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; are one of the newer teams hailing from the Argentinian part of Patagonia, in their case, Comodoro Rivadavia. In fact, the 22nd of September will mark only their first year of existence... and for most leagues, that first year doesn't have much in it but building up. Vendaval have certainly been doing that, and they want to spend their anniversary helping do the same for the rest of the Patagonian community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Flyer for Vendaval Roller Derby's Anniversary." src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/images/2019/09/vendaval_flyer.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, that community has been working together as a closely-allied group, transcending team boundaries for some time now. Indeed, despite the challenges of the region, Patagonia has hosted the southern-most roller derby tournament for several years running now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As such, this first anniversary is also a center for more developments in this area: the anniversary event is somewhere between a bootcamp and a convocation for Patagonian leagues. As well as theoretical sessions on dealing with injuries and proper exercise, run by coaching service &lt;em&gt;LP Deportes en Patín&lt;/em&gt;, there will also be physical training sessions, and a large shared lunch designed to encourage sharing and connection between the attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Collaboration is essential, but holding games also needs infrastructure and resources. Vendaval will be hosting the first ever public exploration of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com/short-track-roller-derby-resources/"&gt;Short Track Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt;  in Argentina in aid of this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we've &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/categories/short-track-roller-derby/"&gt;written about&lt;/a&gt; before, Short Track Roller Derby is a version of the sport created by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://rollaskateclub.com"&gt;Rolla Skate Club&lt;/a&gt; to enable derby to be played with less space, time, resources and officials than the more established versions do. As such, it's an excellent additional tool to help Roller Derby develop and progress in regions, like Patagonia, where recruitment may be harder, and finding suitable spaces for a full-size WFTDA-standard track impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vendaval Roller Derby's birthday event will start at &lt;strong&gt;9am&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;22nd September&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be hosted at:
&lt;em&gt;Club In. Luis A. Huergo, Av. del Libertador 450, Comodoro Rivadavia, Chubut, Argentina&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>argentine roller derby</category><category>latin american roller derby</category><category>rolla skate club</category><category>short track roller derby</category><category>vendaval roller derby</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2019/09/Vendaval_shorttrack/</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2019 19:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
