On August 18th, they will be taking on Granite City's Fight Hawks at Grangemouth Sports Complex.
&lt;p&gt;This is the Belters' first game since early 2017 and sees a few changes to their team. Whilst some skaters have moved on or retired, the Belters have also had some new faces join their squad, including a couple of familiar faces that used to play elsewhere in Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fight Hawks had a great year in 2017, winning all five of the games they played. Now in 2018 they already have 3 games under their belt, the most recent a close bout against Dundee Roller Derby's Bonnie Colliders last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the details can be found over on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/events/1767150326733129/"&gt;event page here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since May of 2015 they have only lost 1 out of the six games they have played. This has seen them climb the rankings during 2016  from 353rd at the start of the year,  to137th where they currently sit. As it is the end of the year, the belters recently voted in their new Captain and Vice for 2017 so I took the opportunity to ask their exiting captain and vice a few questions about their year in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Captain:&lt;/strong&gt; Macfarlane 606 #Mac
&lt;strong&gt;Vice Captain:&lt;/strong&gt; JaneSaw Massacre 254 #JM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-12497 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/belters-w2.jpg?w=700" alt="Captain and vice on the offence" width="700" height="560"&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After a mixed 2015 (5 games: 2 wins 3 losses), did you set yourselves any goals for the team?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; At the time, the 2015 season was our most successful season to date. Our main goal was for the team to capitalise on our success and hopefully better it in 2016.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; Losing does get boring after a while so we really just set out to win through determination, hard work and commitment to training week in and week out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This year you played three games, two less than last year. Was this a specific choice you made?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; It wasn’t a conscious decision, we did have more games lined up at the beginning of the year but they were cancelled due to reasons out with our control. But I think it has worked out really well for us as we had a few new skaters join our team.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; A benefit of being part of a Co-ed League is the opportunity to play in the Co-ed bouts as well. Our league is very flexible, quite a few of our skaters Guest elsewhere, and join in with other League training sessions, it means that those who want to bout more can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Although the Belters played less games, 2016 was a fantastic year as you won all of your games. Did you think at the beginning of the year that was a possibility?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; I had a feeling we would capitalise on our success at the end of the 2015 but I really didn’t think we would have the season that we did! We lost a few skaters at the beginning of the year, which meant our roster was reduced but we seemed to have made our small roster work to our advantage!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first two games of 2016 saw you win both by quite a margin (405pts and 248pts), was the differential a big surprise to you after the games?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; Yes, our rankings were so low compared to the other teams that solely going by the predictor it looked like we would be facing an uphill battle.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; It was a surprise to me. Against Belfast City Rockets I expected us to do well but with them a good few places above us in Flat Track Stats rankings before we played I hoped maybe we'd have a chance of taking the win. North Cheshire Victory Rollers were similarly ranked to us so I expected a really close game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;During 216 you have never had a full roster and usually play with 9 or 10. Some teams struggle playing with that amount of players, why do you think this hasn't been the case with the Belters this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; Playing short is always difficult but we have managed to make it work for us this year.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; We work well under pressure, a smaller roster means more track time even though its tiring!
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; We all have set roles in the team now, rather than having lots of skaters cover a couple of positions. We have been lucky to have a line-up manager that knows the team really well, which means each line is as strong as it possibly can be.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; I think having less players on game day helps to keep us focussed and play cleanly as you can’t afford foul outs because you are playing so short. Everyone has their job to do and we trust each other to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Your roster is largely the same as it was the last year and a half with the exception of a few skaters who have left. Do you think this has been of benefit to you?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; It's always sad to say goodbye to skaters who’ve been part of the team and league no matter for how short or long a period of time.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; We have found what works best for the team and we have became a lot more focused in training and what we want out of games. We also have a strong team bond, with all team members not just the core group of skaters.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; We have set roles in the team, which has made a huge difference.  Knowing how people skate, what they like and don’t, learning set “plays”, spending time with each other, all helps, we laugh a lot, I love that.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; Having a strong core of skaters has been a benefit to the team. Knowing each other's strengths and weaknesses makes sure we support each other on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-12498 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/belters-team.jpg?w=700" alt="Team shot" width="700" height="394"&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You have had a few new skaters this year who have integrated well into your team so much so you would be forgiven for not realising it was their first games. Why do you think that is?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; I think a lot of this has to go back to the individuals, they are totally committed to the training programme and wanted to bout, so they made it happen for themselves.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; Our new skaters have managed to find their role within the team very quickly. I feel this is down to working together lots at training and making sure each new skater feels like a welcome addition to the team.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; Also with having such a small New Skater intake our skaters got a lot of attention, one to one training and scrimmed lots before their first games.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; We have more skaters due to come through in the near future so hopefully our high standard continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have any of your new skaters stood out and impressed you this year?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; All the new skaters have impressed me in so many different ways! Their attitude towards training has been excellent. They came into the team in a time of change and really stepped up to the challenge! After both of RonaCoaster and Volcanic Ash’s first games I have had people say how impressed they are that these two new skaters are playing at such a high level so early on in their derby career.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; They all have, we had two skaters come through BCR’s New Skater Programme and one Transfer Skater.  We’re very fortunate to have them, they’re awesome!  Quality over quantity all the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-12496 size-large" src="https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2016/12/belters-w1.jpg?w=700" alt="in action" width="700" height="467"&gt; Picture courtesy of Laura MacDonald&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Over the last 2 years we have slowly seen a change in the Belters playing style, what would you attribute this to and has it helped with your game results?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac: &lt;/b&gt;Having consistency in the leadership and coaching has helped shape our playing style. We decided to focus on using a few simple yet effective tactics which has allowed us to really up our game, this has allowed our newer skaters to get up to speed relatively quickly as well.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; I think that quite a few of our League members also Referee/NSO on a regular basis throughout Scotland and further afield really helps us with rules and game play. We’re also very lucky to benefit from skilled coaches, most of whom skate or have skated for Power of Scotland Mens Roller Derby.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; We are also very lucky that we have the opportunity to practice our tactics against the Skelpies at each training session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since 2015 your ranking has been on the move up but really jumped in 2016 thanks to your 4 game unbeaten run going back to November 2015. Do you think that the team can continue this on in 2017?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; I am very hopeful our success will continue into 2017. We have voted in an excellent captain and vice for the new season who will make sure we work hard! We will just need to keep the hard work at training and organise as many scrims as we possibly can to ensure we have lots of time to practice as a team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finally throughout your time as Captain and vice what what has been your fondest memory and moments that stand out over the last year in charge?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; We changed our logo and colours throughout the year to tie in with the Skelpies and main League colours.  That felt like a fresh start and I think that's what the Belters needed.
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; My fondest memory is just seeing how much the team has improved. Everyone has upped their game and we all have the same goals for the team.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; I’ve loved all of 2016!  I joined S&amp;amp;T and started coaching on Monday nights endurance and skills based training, that was interesting, especially when I brought the rugby tackle bags to training!
&lt;b&gt;Mac:&lt;/b&gt; My favourite game this year was our last one against the Furness Firecrakers. It was our biggest challenge and we fought right to the end and we came out on top.
&lt;b&gt;JM:&lt;/b&gt; The Furness game was a particular highlight for me what with all the lead changes throughout the game. That really was a fight to the finish with both teams leaving everything on the track.  That was also the first game I got to play in with my sister (Volcanic Ash) and her cherry popper!  So that game will always be special.&lt;/p&gt;

Now as they approach their 4th birthday they are kicking of celebrations and ending their 2016 season in the best way they could, a co-ed game. Their opponents will be the Brawler Buddies, who are made up of skaters from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/granitecitybrawlers/"&gt;Granite City Brawlers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/GraniteCityRollerDerby/"&gt;Granite City Roller Derby&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/dundeerollergirls/"&gt;Dundee Roller Girls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In change from the norm, there will be no advanced ticket sales for this event. Instead in celebration of their 4th birthday BCR are inviting spectators to pay what they want on the day. That's right, &lt;span class="_4n-j fsl"&gt;just turn up on the game and pay whatever you like.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game will take place at Grangemouth Sports Complex on Saturday the 15th of October, doors will be open from 2.15pm and first whistle will be at 2.40pm, for more information &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/527945357409228/"&gt;visit the event page here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the second time these teams have faced each other on track. The first encounter dating way back to July 2013,  when it was Furness who skated to victory taking the win that day by a large margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven't seen much of the Belters on track this year but they have gotten two games so far under their belt for 2016. Those coming against Belfast City (home) and North Cheshire (away) and in both cases they have emerged victorious.  Since May of last year, the Belters have only lost one out of the five games they have played, which has seen them climb up the European rankings to 180th where they currently stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With it being over three years since these teams last played each other much has changed for both in that time, but there is only one way to see out how much and if the Belters will take the win this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doors are at 14:15, &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/bcr-central-belters-v-furness-firecrackers-tickets-27243993518?utm-medium=discovery&amp;amp;utm-campaign=social&amp;amp;utm-content=attendeeshare&amp;amp;aff=escb&amp;amp;utm-source=cp&amp;amp;utm-term=listing"&gt;tickets can be purchased online in advance here&lt;/a&gt; or at the door on game day.

&lt;p&gt;For fans of Scotland's first Co-ed league, the good news is that this weekend sees the end of the drought, as BCR host a double-header of roller derby action in traditional venue &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Grangemouth+Sports+Complex/@56.0116517,-3.7227819,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x488879aaeb85b4ed:0x204ad804f85c6304!8m2!3d56.0116487!4d-3.7205879"&gt;Grangemouth Sports Complex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, from &lt;strong&gt;2pm Saturday.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, BCR's women's team, the &lt;strong&gt;Central Belters&lt;/strong&gt;, will be taking to the track against &lt;strong&gt;Belfast City Rockets&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the Belters' first bout in their new kit - retiring the old grey-and-green in favour of a new logo (a howling wolf) in what used to be the Skelpies-only scheme of red-and-blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belfast City are ranked by FlatTrackStats as extremely close in power to the Central Belters - the bout is assigned as being &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://flattrackstats.com/bouts/80412/rankings"&gt;almost 50:50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for each team to win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this, it's Bairn City's men's team, the &lt;strong&gt;Skelpies&lt;/strong&gt;, up against Aberdeen's finest, the &lt;strong&gt;Granite City Brawlers &lt;/strong&gt;(who have also switched from Brawlermen to Brawlers since their founding). While the Brawlers have played several games in an unofficial or closed capacity, this is their first Public Bout, so it's a chance to see how the newest Scottish men's league perform!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(As this is GCB's first bout, FlatTrackStats is unable to predict the result of this match up - but as GCB and the Skelpies both have skaters in Power of Scotland, it might be closer than you expect!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The city’s first men’s roller derby team – Mean City – are once again hosting a special double-decker featuring top male and female skaters from north and south of the border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/mean-wirrals.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class=" wp-image-3883 alignright" src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/09/mean-wirrals.jpg?w=300" alt="Mean Wirrals" width="416" height="164"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean City Roller Derby will be taking on Wirral’s Pack Animals in an all-male clash, while the all-female, all-awesome Cannie Gingers from Glasgow Roller Derby will go toestop to toestop with fellow Scots, the sensational Central Belters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be a rock ‘n’ roll day out for sports fans of all ages – combining skills, thrills and spills … all on skates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny Reid, Chairman of Mean City Roller Derby (MCRD), said: “We can’t wait for this very special double-header. Mean City is Glasgow’s first and only men’s roller derby league and has been going from strength to strength since it was formed in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re genuinely thrilled to be welcoming three amazing squads to Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pack Animals are a great team and a terrific bunch of lads – we can’t wait to line up against them. Mean City features some of the best skaters in Scotland and we will be giving our all to ensure the super summer of sport continues in Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pack Animals hail from the wilds of the Wirral and are coming north aiming to take Mean City’s scalp, but we’re aiming to be the leaders of this Pack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean City recorded their first ever victory in August against Teesside's Skate Invaders and are hungry for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meawhile, Glasgow Roller Derby (GRD) – Mean City’s all-female sister league – is renowned throughout the roller derby world. Its A team – the Irn Bruisers –stormed America earlier this year, while its B team – the Maiden Grrders – are also a force to be reckoned with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such is the strength in depth at GRD that a third travel team has been formed – the Cannie Gingers – and they are already making a name for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mighty Central Belters – part of Bairn City Rollers – all hail from Central Scotland and will be heading west aiming to pop the Gingers’ bubble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenny added: “This is the first team these four teams have clashed and it’s going to be awesome. You’ll be treated to two full-on games of roller derby for just £5 – free entry to under-14s with a paying adult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s going to be a great showcase of all that roller derby has to offer – an action-packed afternoon of skating, scoring, skills, thrills and spills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you’ve never been to a roller derby bout, get along to the ARC on October 4 – there will be action, fun, entertainment, refreshments and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The double-header takes place at The ARC, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow, on Saturday, October 4, 2014 – from 11.30am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean City Roller Derby has been developing as a league since its formation in 2012. Men’s roller derby is a fledgling off-shoot of the modern day all-female sport of roller derby – with the game rising in popularity with people of all genders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mean City train regularly in the Glasgow area and new members are always welcome to give the sport a go in a supportive environment. Equipment can be provided – just get in touch in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/01/img_0062-copy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="size-large wp-image-3151" alt="Bairn City's Belter Skelpers lining up for the team's first ever co-ed bout." src="http://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/2014/01/img_0062-copy.jpg?w=614" width="614" height="409"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bairn City's Belter Skelpers lining up for the team's first ever co-ed bout. (Photo: Laura MacDonald)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bairn City Rollers have had a very busy year, managing almost one bout for every month, despite only starting in May. While it's certainly made an impression on Scottish derby, how has the pace affected the league as a whole?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skelpies only played 3 public bouts, so we have found it very manageable.
I think the Belters found it okay as their roster grew quite rapidly during 2013, so each bout had 5/6 "cherry poppers" in their line up. Most of the girls have also just come out of their first year with an abundance of priceless experience after going head to head with some top teams like Furness Firecrackers, Rainy City and Lothian Derby Dolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, the majority of those bouts were women's bouts, with the Central Belters taking on a rather varied selection of opponents. What was your favourite bout that the Belters played? Are there particular opponents you're planning to make rematches with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, the bout against Preston.
In my opinion, August 25th was a turning point for the Belters. They had had a massive turn around in personnel, with the new girls coming in an doing an incredible job. Seeing everyone gel so well on track was very pleasing to watch!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the Skelpies and the Belters have had invites to rematches flooding in, but we have also had interest from new opponents in equal measure.
We are planning on heading down to Barrow to play our good friends in Barrow Infernos again, so I'm looking forward to settling the score there!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of rematches, the Central Belters' first win came in the Battle of Britain tournament, playing their very first opponents, Lothian Derby Dolls, once more. Just from the crowd reaction, it was clear that the win meant a lot to the team; tell us more about the Belters got there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win against Lothian was a massive milestone for the girls. As you mentioned, the Dolls were their first opponents on the 18th of May. The Belters were beaten and have, since then, worked tirelessly to improve. The Belters spent the next few months bouting teams such as North Wales, Furness Firecrackers, Rainy City, Preston etc. and scrimming against even more.
Every week has shown steady improvement for the Belters, which came to fruition as they held their own at the Battle of Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, your co-ed team, the Belter Skelpers, only managed to find one team to play them, and that a combination of Mean City and New Town working together.  Being one of the very first co-ed leagues in Scotland (and, indeed, the UK), has the disadvantage of providing very few opponents. How are Bairn City planning on improving competition in the co-ed game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belters Skelpers VS Mean Town was a lot of fun, and a very close game! We had quite a lot of feedback from people that watched the bout, saying how much fun they had.
There was interest in us playing coed bouts in England earlier on in the year, but we decided to concentrate on the Skelpies and Central Belters individually first.
We've also had quite a lot of mix teams come to Falkirk to scrim against us, which may hopefully spur a few public bouts in 2014.
Coed still seems a bit taboo with a percentage of the Derby community, but our doors are always open for people to come train with us to check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Skelpies had the honour of starting off Bairn City's bouting year, playing South Wales Silures back in April to a packed crowd. They'll also be starting off the new year, playing Mean City on the 25th of January. How do you feel the Skelpies have developed over the year? Are you predicting a win to start off 2014?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skelpies have played some tough opponents this year. We kicked things off against South Wales Silures in April, which contained many skaters that had previously skated for The Expendables in the 2012 European Championships. We then played against Tyne and Fear in June and a Barrow Infernos/Tyne and Fear mixed team in July, who speak for themselves. They were both very good teams.
Since then we have been doing nothing but train as hard as we can, scrim as often as we can and hopefully the benefits of that will be reaped throughout 2014.
I wouldn't like to predict anything against Mean City, in all honesty. Mean City will be a difficult team to beat with Konanbourg, Tea Virus, Whyte &amp;amp; MacDie and Zero G all making the Scotland roster. I have also played alongside BruiseDog, Blue Grass, Samikaze and Grizzly so I know what talent their team possesses.
We also have a few new faces ready to take to the track, who I am sure will more than raise a few eyebrows, however I'm not willing to give away too much!
I think both teams are evenly matched and it is poised to be an incredible bout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quite a few of Bairn City's Skelpies tried out for Power of Scotland, the Scottish Men's Roller Derby team, and many of them got in. How does it feel to have gone from "new league" to providing a reasonable chunk of the national team in so short a time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started Bairn City, I honestly wasn't too sure we would transcend above a recreational league however the competitive nature and desire to take individual development to that next level has been second to none. Everyone within the league has shown complete dedication to improvment and moving the league forward, so it feels incredible to see everyone's hard work paying off.
It made me so proud to see so many of my team mates being selected. Myself, Dreads (Dreadie Mercury) and Dead Hardy have been here from day one, with Baron and Shady joining a few months after.
I think we're over our honeymoon period though, and as they say "the hard work starts now."
Looking through the Scotland roster it's good to see Capital City, Mean City and the Brawlermen all being represented at this years World Cup. It will bring about a positive boost for men's derby in Scotland and I can't wait to see what 2014 will hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With this year now over, can you tell us about Bairn City's plans for the future? What's coming up in 2014? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's a few very exciting things going on behind closed doors, but I'm afraid Basha Roo might hip check me if I told you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Skelpies have a big year coming up, with some of us going to the World Cup in March. We also have a couple of details to iron out on a few more events, which I'm really looking forward to.
The Belters are also currently booking up their year, with a few away bouts that will see them leave the comfort of Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a whole, we hope 2014 turns out to be as fun as 2013, that we can continue to grow and introduce more people to the wonders of Roller Derby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>articles</category><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>bcr</category><category>belter skelpers</category><category>central belters</category><category>interviews</category><category>review of the year</category><category>skelpies</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2014/01/10/derby-review-2014-bairn-city-rollers/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2014 16:09:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Bairn City Rollers presents “Blockémon”</title><link>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/07/18/bairn-city-rollers-presents-blockemon/</link><dc:creator>graememcphail</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derby fans, we choose YOU!

&lt;p&gt;Exciting times ahead as the East meets the Centre, &lt;a href="http://lothianderbydolls.com/"&gt;Lothian Derby Dolls&lt;/a&gt; taking on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BairnCityRollers"&gt;Bairn City Rollers&lt;/a&gt;' women's team, the Central Belters, in what will be both teams' first ever public bout!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking for LDD, Duke Boxx had this to say: "We certainly can't wait to welcome family and friends to our first ever public bout and also the Central Belters first ever public bout. So come along and cheer on some girls popping their bouting cherry and we can certainly sweeten the pot with some yummy home baked goods, goodies to be won and what is set to be fun an exciting roller derby."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>bairn city rollers</category><category>central belters</category><category>lothian derby dolls</category><category>upcoming bouts</category><guid>https://www.scottishrollerderbyblog.com/posts/2013/04/17/2516/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Apr 2013 19:44:38 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
