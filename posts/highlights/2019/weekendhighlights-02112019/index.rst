Despite being a bit busy, we're trying a new thing this week to give us more space, and are grouping all "National tournament" fixtures on a date for a given country into one entry - so here, Dijon and Saint-Gratien share a Championnat de France spot. With this being the week of Halloween, there's a lot of "spooky" events earlier in the week and on the weekend, but there's some very exciting other developments, including the first internal interleague bout in Uruguay, Liverpool Roller Birds' 10th anniversary, and the Rebellion tournament returning to Melbourne for another year!

The rules are, as usual: highlights limited to 1 event per country, with an "extra" event allowed for a different kind of fixture
(so, 1 tournament and 1 bootcamp), or if they involve Scottish leagues (since we are the *Scottish* Roller Derby Blog).
Other notability might also allow the extra event - great posters, notable teams, etc. (League birthdays may count as "special" enough, at our discretion ;) )

In a bid to make this list as useful as possible, we've avoided links to Facebook except where noted.
(Links to Teams are to non-Facebook resources - Instagram, or actual team pages - we'd strongly recommend that Teams
get themselves an actual webpage [we can help host one if you need help]).

Locations are roughly organised East-West (with things before the weekend out sequence at the start).

The `Deskarriadas`_ host their 4th Skating Family (Patinetada Familiar Osorno) event, where they will be skating a 3 km course (but the community on wheels, big or small are all invited to take part).

We believe that this event is still taking place, despite the recent protests, and oppressive response from the Chilean government; signs are that the Government has stood down from their response, so far, this week.
